That is the question many startups are thinking of due to the current climate being exceptionally favorable for going public. Accel Partner Harry Nelis kicks off our article series on the topic with his take on the issue and goes through the things one should consider before making this decision.<\/p>\n<p>For private technology companies, it may seem like there has never been a better time to raise money. With revenues and profits at all-time highs and multiples also climbing to new peaks, valuations have never been more favorable. That was reflected in a surging IPO market last year, with the US public markets welcoming<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/a-record-pace-for-ipos-2021-01-14\">\u00a0almost double<\/a>\u00a0the number of new listings than in 2019. The private markets are no less busy: despite the interruptions of the pandemic, venture capital investment across Europe and Israel hit a<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/news\/articles\/hot-or-not-where-european-vc-funding-went-in-2020\">\u00a0new record<\/a>\u00a0level in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>The reasons for this surge are familiar: the shift from offline to online industries accelerated by the pandemic, massive liquidity injections from central banks, and an increasing appetite for growth investments in a low-yield world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For the companies themselves, the dilemma that follows is more complicated: how are they best to use these conditions to further the growth of their business? Should they stay private for longer in a market that allows larger and later fundraisings than ever before? Or, to liberally paraphrase The Clash, should they go and begin a new chapter on the public markets?<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;Becoming a public company demands a significant shift in your approach to building a business. Things that worked as a private company will not be accepted on the public markets.&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-upper-margin b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p>To answer that question, a company needs to consider two things: firstly, the advantages of operating as a public company, and when these start to become relevant to them; and secondly, the requirements of being a public company, and when these start to become feasible for them.<\/p>\n<p>The advantages of being public can be counted in visibility, credibility, and liquidity. The public markets are deeper, they make companies better known to a wider pool of investors, and they compel them to meet a higher standard of audit and compliance \u2013 building confidence with all stakeholders. Going public is also a significant benefit for companies looking to make acquisitions: a listed stock provides a form of transparent, openly-valued currency that gives reassurance to counterparties and reduces friction in deal-making. And it\u2019s one route of providing the return that early investors will eventually require \u2013 although it must be emphasized that the listing itself is not an exit, the next chapter in a company\u2019s journey, and most of these investors will remain involved for at least the next 12-18 months.<\/p>\n<p>But to gain the advantages, you first have to be able to meet the requirements.\u00a0Becoming a public company demands a significant shift in your approach to building a business. Things that worked as a private company will not be accepted on the public markets.\u00a0For example, a startup may set an over-ambitious target and be applauded by its board for reaching 95% of an almost impossible goal. Public investors are different and demand predictability: there\u2019s no lenience for missing targets \u2013 a company must be able to confidently and accurately forecast its performance several quarters into the future.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;Ultimately, most fast-growing companies will know the point at which going public has become a good route for them.&#8221;][vc_column_text]This more structured approach to running a company requires the right people to lead it. Before going public, a company will need to make some well-chosen hires: a CFO who is as comfortable with explaining the business model to Wall Street investors as with running an effective finance department; board members with the experience to chair the audit and risk &amp; compliance committees; and independent directors who will help to build the confidence of institutional investors. All these people need to be in place and settled at least a few quarters before the business goes public.<\/p>\n<p>So to those companies who are asking themselves whether to seek a public listing, make sure you can answer the following questions: is your business model predictable and stable enough to build the confidence of public market investors; have you identified the strategic hires that will be needed to make your business a seaworthy public company; are you willing to accept the additional transparency and scrutiny involved?<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, most fast-growing companies will know the point at which going public has become a good route for them.\u00a0They reach a tipping point at which being private starts to become a limitation, and being public would convey meaningful advantages, helping to enable future growth. But being ready is not the same as being prepared. A company can\u2019t simply reach this inflection and press a button: they must have anticipated getting to that point and integrated the necessary people and structures in advance.\u00a0Again, going public is not an exit: the first two years of trading are vital, and it\u2019s essential that a company arrives on the public markets ready to hit the ground running.[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;As a public company, there are no pit-stops and few opportunities for running repairs. So make absolutely sure your car is ready before you choose to put it on the grid.&#8221;][vc_column_text]To do so, think of your company like a racing car. These are tested not at medium speed, but at full throttle to put every component under stress and determine its viability. Only at maximum acceleration can you start to hear parts of the engine whining and the body creaking. These are the faults that need to be identified in testing \u2013 your final quarters as a private company \u2013 so they can be fixed before the race begins.\u00a0As a public company, there are no pit stops and few opportunities for running repairs.
