That\u2019s why it was quite alright for Anna to get on board later in the company\u2019s journey. While HR as a whole was still a no man\u2019s land, Asana had identified the things that simply needed to get done for the company to run:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compensation? Taken care of by CEO and Asana\u2019s Head of Finance.<\/li>\n<li>Feedback? Coordinated by an eager engineering team employee.<\/li>\n<li>Learning? A designer who was\u00a0<i>really<\/i>\u00a0passionate about the subject.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Prior to Anna\u2019s arrival, Asana\u2019s people operations were kept going by a simple thesis: find out which tasks are important, and distribute those amongst people with a knack for the topic.\u00a0It is also why she could hit the ground running. She didn\u2019t have to start building in a vacuum, but already had a full house of helpful people who knew how to run these things.<\/p>\n<p>At an early stage, it is much more powerful to identify the things that need to be done \u2013 no matter the weather \u2013 and then have these things owned by different parts of the organization, rather than hiring a People operations professional to twiddle her thumbs in a corner.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;So\u2026 are they doing a good job?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html narrow\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p>It isn\u2019t always simple to know if you\u2019re doing the right thing, especially when managing people. How do you evaluate success when it is based on something as fickle as, well, people? Anna has a few different mixed-method measures she uses daily, in order to keep her own work in check.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, Asana has ten objectives that are the central guide to everything the company does. They include things such as revenue growth, customer acquisition, international expansion, and employee engagement. One of her primary checks for herself is ensuring that the HR team\u2019s work is in support of those objectives.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, the KPIs you set for a person taking care of your talent should be eclectic. Anna mixes both quantitative and qualitative measures when keeping herself in check. As an example: it is important for her to keep the engagement survey response rates at 90 percent. Even if people are unhappy, they should be engaged enough to let her know what\u2019s wrong.<\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s not all about numbers when keeping track of your employee engagement, as attrition rates don\u2019t tell you the whole story. If the people leaving are your top performers, there\u2019s definitely a problem with how they are being managed. \u201cI\u2019d rather lose ten bad ones than two good ones,\u201d Anna says.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;How does Anna ensure employees are engaged?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html narrow\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p><b>People need to know that their work matters.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Everyone needs to be able to connect the dots from their daily work all the way up to the company mission. \u201cThis approach requires above average levels of transparency and communication, but we believe that the people in our team are worth it, because it leads to better outcomes faster. It also enables us to hire better teammates, because talented people want to bring their full capabilities and directly influence outcomes.

I also want to model that behavior for the whole company.<\/p>\n<p>Asana\u2019s culture prioritizes a sense of belonging. \u201cUltimately, building a great culture is about the people, not the perks. To truly foster innovation, you must first foster a workplace culture that recognizes the unique and diverse contribution each employee brings,\u201d Anna explains.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>People need to be able to show vulnerability.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Expressing vulnerability and admitting to your fiercest embarrassments is not only allowed at Asana \u2013 it\u2019s a core leadership trait. \u201cIf you\u2019ve sat in a room with our executive team, you see it every single week,\u201d Anna says.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve recently renewed our company values to reflect our belief in the\u00a0<i>power of vulnerability<\/i>.\u201d A culture of vulnerability and \u201creal talk\u201d also helps in setting a solid ground for giving and receiving feedback \u2013 two distinct skills. \u201cThis can be uncomfortable, but is essential for any company to have a growth mindset,\u201d Anna states. Ultimately, the culture of vulnerability also helps the employees who are in the most vulnerable positions, such as underrepresented groups, who may often feel pressured to act self-confident and unfazed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Culture must constantly evolve based on feedback.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Asana treats their culture as a product: both are constantly evolving, built on intentional design, and improved over time through constant feedback and iteration.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few ways Asana approaches culture in this way:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pinpoint the end-user experience and the outcomes you\u2019re aiming for.<\/li>\n<li>Design thoughtfully.<\/li>\n<li>Build and implement (programs, comms).<\/li>\n<li>Monitor, test and get regular feedback.<\/li>\n<li>Fix the bugs.\u00a0This is important \u2013 you have to be prepared to acknowledge where things have gone wrong or haven\u2019t worked, learn from it and evolve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Anna\u2019s advice on creating a feedback culture that sticks&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html narrow\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p><b>If your leadership doesn\u2019t make time for feedback, no one will.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Asana has dedicated feedback cycles where managers give feedback on impact, opportunities and growth plans. Doing them more than once a year makes the process faster, lightweight and timely.<\/p>\n<p>We advise managers to include bi-directional feedback into every weekly one on one they have with their direct reports. That way, people get into the habit of doing it and it\u2019s less of a big, scary thing.
