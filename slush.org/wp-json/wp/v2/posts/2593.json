It serves a strategic purpose, and should be seen through such a lense. Much like the vision and mission, it is a framework that helps employees align their thinking and actions towards reaching shared goals. Writing and implementing a culture handbook is particularly useful for startups that are hiring at speed, all the while trying to steer their growing organization in a common direction.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of a culture handbook came to us at Smartly.io when the company had doubled its size from 50 to 100 people in six months, and our team was increasingly distributed across continents. At that point, our culture was strong, but implicit. It got passed down from old to new employees by a sort of osmosis. We worried about how it would be adopted by the expanding and diversifying team. Things were bound to be lost in translation unless we made the culture and values explicit.<\/p>\n<p>However, be critical when documenting your culture to hold on only values and those parts of the culture that defines your success as an organization. Otherwise, the culture handbook could reassert an exclusive culture only for a homogenous group of people. Diversity and inclusion should be taken into account from the start by building a welcoming environment that fosters safety and a sense of belonging. This starts by actively asking, listening, and involving everyone in your organization.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Double down on details and concrete examples to define your culture.&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]A tacit culture is sensitive to interpretation. We stumbled upon this at Smartly.io when we recognized that one of our founding values, humbleness, translated into discrepant behaviors in people from different cultural backgrounds. It wasn\u2019t enough to say that we are humble, we needed to define what being humble meant in practice in the Smartly.io context.<\/p>\n<p>To create a culture handbook that helps the organization behave in a confluent way, you need to optimize for clarity and practicality over everything else. Share concrete examples of how the company culture should manifest itself in interactions with colleagues and customers, as well as how it influences decision-making and prioritization. Show, don\u2019t tell, what kind of behavior your company values, and you\u2019ll make it easier for your people to act accordingly.[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;Being a Humble Hungry Hunter is clearly depicted in how we do sales at Smartly.io.

These teams usually have a relatively clear understanding of what the culture is like or at least what it should be, and soliciting the opinions of a larger group tends to make the process less straightforward. We insist, however, that the entire organization needs to have the opportunity to take part in documenting the culture.<\/p>\n<p>Inviting the whole organization to chip in generates a shared sense of ownership, which in turn makes your employees more likely to embrace the result of the work. Interviewing founders and early team members, looking for stories on how the culture is demonstrated in daily work, hosting open feedback rounds and crowdsourcing content proved to be useful ways of getting the whole team\u2019s input when creating our own handbook.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;A public culture handbook is great for your employer brand.&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]While a culture handbook primarily serves an internal purpose, publishing it on your career page is a superb way of giving potential applicants a glimpse of your ways of working and helping them decide if they would like to join your team. We get constant feedback that our culture handbook has played a significant role in persuading new Smartlies to come work for us.<\/p>\n<p>Going public with a culture handbook may tempt you to polish things up and exclude anything that might make potential job applicants turn the other way. Don\u2019t shoot yourself in the leg, optimize for transparency instead. For example, our culture handbook states that people who need constant management don\u2019t do well at Smartly.io. Entrepreneurially-minded applicants usually get excited about it, whereas people who prefer more clear-cut responsibility areas tend to pass us up, saving both their time and ours.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2605&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]<em>An honest culture handbook attracts the kind of people who will thrive in your culture and repels those who wouldn\u2019t.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You might also hesitate to share details of your company culture out of fear for copycats.

A culture handbook is only legitimate as long as it\u2019s in line with reality. At Smartly.io, we have implemented our values and cultural principles into how we approach recruiting and onboarding, leadership, internal communication and feedback, as well as recognizing and rewarding employees.<\/p>\n<p>If you want your people to act according to your values and culture, they need to be visible in the daily life of the organization. Two years back, no more than a handful of Smartlies remembered our six values. Only after the values were visualized and incorporated at the root of our internal communications, did people start to remember them by heart. Today, we even have customized value emojis that Smartlies have put to use in our internal chats.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2606&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]<em>Visualizing values makes them easier to memorize and more fun to use in internal communications.<\/em>[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Your culture (handbook) is never ready.&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]When we set out to write the culture handbook, we believed that culture is fairly static\u2014something that stays more or less unchanged regardless of location or time. Over the course of the writing process we came to understand that culture, in fact, has a more dynamic nature. It evolves over time and with every new hire and varies between offices\u2014and that\u2019s completely natural.<\/p>\n<p>Startup founders tend to dread changes in culture when their companies grow, establish offices abroad, or hire new leadership. However, culture needs to evolve in order to support the growing company. For example, \u201cwe\u2019re full stack\u201d used to be a basic tenet of the early Smartly.io culture, preferring generalists over specialists. Some years later we realized that we needed to introduce a certain degree of specialization in order to grow sustainably. We toned down on this attribute, emphasising trust and transparency instead, in order to keep our culture collaborative and steer clear of siloing.<\/p>\n<p>As the culture is going to change anyway, it makes sense to guide that change in the right direction. Recruitment decisions are one of the most impactful ways to nurture your culture. When a company grows, it needs people with diverse backgrounds and different ways of thinking and solving problems to help take the company to the next level of success. So, rather than conserving the culture by looking for exact culture fits, companies should hire people who are committed to their values but elevate the culture in order to build more diverse, inclusive, and successful teams.<\/p>\n<p>Since the culture evolves as the company grows, it\u2019s crucial to keep on reviewing and refreshing the culture handbook regularly. At Smartly.io, we have been revisiting and reiterating our handbook on a yearly cadence. Building a culture handbook that stays strategically relevant over time requires commitment, but it\u2019s worth the effort. At its best, a culture handbook can be a useful tool in guiding an organization through the different stages of growth.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221;
