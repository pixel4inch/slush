Before implementing any tactics, you need to slow down and nail your message.<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Where to spend budget\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Look into hiring someone that can be a sounding board for your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9_kIt-gShW4\">narrative<\/a>\u00a0and message. The worst thing you can do is internalize this exercise.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying to spend $30K minimum on a full-stack agency to do the work. I\u2019m talking about getting a consultant to help you get out of your echo chamber.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve used a consultant a few times at multiple companies, and they\u2019ve helped take messaging ideas I viewed as good and helped me reword them to be beyond excellent.<\/p>\n<p>Consultants provide narrative workshops, message clarity sessions, and even content development to help accelerate your differentiated message to your buyer. And the best thing is this: the consultants aren\u2019t biased and will give you raw feedback on how to develop a winning message.<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>How to measure success\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to sound like everyone else.<\/p>\n<p>The best measure of your message resonating is to ask your prospective customers if what you\u2019re telling them is unique or something they haven\u2019t heard before.<\/p>\n<p>The worst they could say is, \u201cYeah, this was terrible.\u201d In which they won\u2019t say that unless they are jerks.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you are in the same category as your competitors, you want to communicate in a way that makes you stand out from them. Because if you don\u2019t, they will always go with the least common denominator: price.<\/p>\n<p>Sales will also tell you right away if the message is resonating or not with their customers. Since they are on the battlefield every day, they know firsthand if customers connect with the narrative or not.

This is not because you can put pretty graphics on a web page.<\/p>\n<p>90% of all your leads will come from inbound marketing that begins with website interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Whether filling out a form, or a customer finding your direct phone number, everything begins with the website, especially if you have little to no outbound sales motions with SDRs, AEs, and partner channels.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, your website should be optimized to 1) get people there and 2) keep people there, so they ultimately express interest in your solutions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Get people there<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Here is where the power of search engine optimization (SEO) comes into play. You may be thinking, \u201cWell, duh Ryan, you got to rank for keywords.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Well, believe it or not, many founders don\u2019t believe SEO is important and would rather try to get quick wins using pay-per-click (PPC) or display ads.<\/p>\n<p>SEO has compounding ROI because it focuses on evergreen content that someone will look for.<\/p>\n<p>When I joined Keyfactor, our average organic traffic was around 5,000 per month.

Their messaging doesn\u2019t get lost in the design, which is huge for capturing attention. They are both customer and information-focused.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Customer Focused<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>You optimize your website for the customer, not the internal marketing team.<\/p>\n<p>Limit animated graphics, limit cuteness, and be very clear about the value of your solutions and why change is needed.<\/p>\n<p>At my last company,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.keyfactor.com\/\">Keyfactor<\/a>, we spent a lot of time on the home page during a redesign.<\/p>\n<p>The home page had to be amazing, but only 30% of the visitors that came to the home page actually scrolled down.<\/p>\n<p>What does this tell us?<\/p>\n<p>It tells us that whatever you said on your home page headline (hint, hint, why narrative and messaging are crucial!) will impact if the visitor wants to abandon your page or move quickly to see what you offer.<\/p>\n<p>You essentially have one shot at getting them to be interested since only 30% move past your first headline\u2026that\u2019s crazy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Information Focused<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>If they didn\u2019t scroll down, where do you think they went immediately? The navigation.<\/p>\n<p>We found this out using a tool like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crazyegg.com\/snapshots\">CrazyEgg<\/a>\u00a0to see a heatmap of their movement. This means visitors immediately want to investigate if your company is the right fit for them.<\/p>\n<p>Building an informative navigation that\u2019s also not overbearing can be difficult. Just remember to make it clear. When you have a lot of product parody, you need to stand out on your message. If you don\u2019t understand clearly why to go with one vendor over the other, you will default to price.<\/p>\n<p>Building a \u201cWhy [Company Name]\u201d page is so essential. Buyers have to know why they would go with you over someone else.<\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><b>Where to spend budget\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>First, invest in a web agency you can trust. I\u2019ve been using one specific web agency for the last three years at two different positions because I trust them.<\/p>\n<p>They build great websites that allow me full access to a development, design, and digital team for the cost of one FTE. They provide clear direction on hours spent and remaining, so there are zero surprises when my bill arrives.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, they always use WPBakery to build or duplicate new WordPress pages on the fly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-upper-margin b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p>Second, invest in an SEO tool like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\">SEMRush<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\">ahrefs<\/a>, or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.spyfu.com\/\">SpyFu<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Perform a gap analysis of the keywords your competition ranks for, and you don\u2019t. Then organize them into top, middle, and bottom of funnel keywords.<\/p>\n<p>This is crucial for your SEO success because you want to rank for middle and bottom of funnel keywords quickly. These show the highest buyer intent and the quickest way to capture demand.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-upper-margin b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p>Third, invest in a backlink firm to help build your off-page SEO. On-page is something you and a team of freelancers (more on this below) can accomplish. However, backlinking is tough and takes a lot of time.

We pay them $$$!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, I believe many of these complaints are due to resource allocation, not marketing spending. For AR to run correctly, you need someone dedicated to owning the relationships and setting KPIs for the year.<\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t need to be a full-time role, but it does need ownership from either marketing or product. When I was leading product marketing at Tricentis and Keyfactor, I owned the relationships with the major analyst firms.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t my full-time job, but it took more time than I wanted. So what can you do on a budget?<\/p>\n<p>First, you can always request a briefing without a paid seat. This doesn\u2019t mean that analysts will always take your request, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to request one. Since they get hundreds of requests a month, you\u2019ll need to stand out.<\/p>\n<p>To maximize your acceptance of a briefing request, you want to make sure your request gives them value vs you getting value from them. I\u2019ll usually read up on a few of their blogs, research notes, or LinkedIn posts to feel their areas of interest.<\/p>\n<p>Then I\u2019ll title the request and abstract that provided value to their fields of interest, like \u201cA DataOps view of the Data Observability Landscape and 2022 Trends.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Second, you can send analysts monthly or quarterly reports on the state of your business and your POV of the market. At the close of a briefing, I\u2019ll usually ask if it\u2019s OK to send them updates. Most analysts welcome this information because it helps them be better informed when writing their research notes.<\/p>\n<p>And lastly, you can interact with them on social media. Analysts like to post thought leadership and encourage feedback from the community. This gives you a presence to any potential buyers that follow analysts to get their advice on vendor recommendations and industry trends.<\/p>\n<p>In the rare circumstance that your category has some type of market guide, quadrant, wave, etc. you should weigh the pros and cons for shelling out rights to a reprint. These can be extremely helpful for procurement but less helpful if your company is not in these reports.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Skip #2: Peer Review Websites&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Peer review sites like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.g2.com\/\">G2<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustradius.com\/\">TrustRadius<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.peerspot.com\/\">PeerSpot<\/a>\u00a0help customers compare vendors based on peer\/user reviews.
