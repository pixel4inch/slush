As such, potential acquisitions shouldn\u2019t be opportunistic purchases but built around a long-term company roadmap.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe can always test the software and build it ourselves if that\u2019s a better option. It\u2019s just a matter of resources and risk profile. How long will it take? Will it be as good? Where will your competitors be with their feature development?\u00a0There\u2019s a timing element in that. Buying is typically more expensive than building, but it can help you leapfrog the competition. On the other hand, with acquiring features there\u2019s minimal risk of complete failure alongside additional advantages: most notably great founders and great teams.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBefore our first acquisition,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/elev.io\/\">Elevio<\/a>, we had formed a strategic view to build a solution that we felt addressed the customer service market\u2019s needs with a combination of knowledge, automation, and intelligence.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Knowledge.\u00a0<\/b>\u201cFor our product to improve, we needed our customer agents to be aware of what they should answer. They needed context and a knowledge base.\u201d<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Automation.\u00a0<\/b>\u201cSecondly, automation is and will be a big part of the system going forward to drive down costs.\u201d<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Intelligence.\u00a0<\/b>\u201cFinally, you need to figure out if all the things you\u2019re doing make sense, to analyze whether we are addressing the root cause of problems.

Elevio provides the knowledge base,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.solvemate.com\/en\/\">Solvemate<\/a>, the automation, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/miuros.com\/\">Miuros<\/a>, the quality assurance.

It would likely be too big a task for us.

As it happens, they also provide an opportunity for assessing the acquisition potential of companies before starting official discussions.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe could do some due diligence just by being technology integration partners. We knew we had a great product fit and then we started listening to what their funding considerations were. Most of these companies would otherwise have gone into classic funding rounds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can then explore the potential for a merger in more informal conversation and wrap it in other excuses: Should we go for this client together? How do we divide and conquer?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>However, you need to be extra careful not to put valuable partnerships at risk.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to be more diligent in your approach because you don\u2019t want to scare people away. We highly value our partners and therefore approached our acquisition targets at a respectfully slow pace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This slow process results in a position where both parties know a potential merger or acquisition is in the cards.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cTypically, the acquired company initiates the process. In our case, we opened negotiations with all the ones we acquired. As we are dealing with partners, we\u2019re extremely serious if we go in and are straight shooters because we don\u2019t want to ruin our relationship if this is not the right thing for both companies. This results in a healthy process, as you have the mentality that we need to be friends regardless of the outcome: the merger needs to be good for your business and for my business.\u201d<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Due diligence&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>What happens in due diligence?<\/i><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"dd\"><\/a>\u201cWe have a talk upfront before signing anything. We aim for two-thirds of the bigger decisions to have been organized pre-acquisition \u2013 before the lawyers get involved. The lawyers and all the advisors are a great asset. Yet the more you can agree on, and the more obstacles you can remove before tons of people get involved, the smoother the process will be as a whole.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Due diligence requires a heavy dose of transparency to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe deal with a lot of assumptions. We are basing our evaluation and our approach on two-thirds of the details. So we need to spend some time together going through the acquisition proposals and analyzing their company, products, technology, and team. Do you truly have this many clients with this much revenue as you mentioned to us earlier? If it turns out that you have less, or you are visibly off on some other key metrics, we need to know now. Founders have to be honest because it will help them find the right home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe founders will also have more requests or \u2018asks\u2019 from the companies in the negotiation phase than at any other time. If it\u2019s super important for them that their brand continues, they need to say that before the signature.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Transparency is of course a two-way street. In acquisitions, where one party is in the stronger negotiating position, talk about equality needs to be matched with actions.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not new ones joining, it\u2019s two entities that are merging, no matter the technical terms of the transaction. You have to show through tangible things that you mean it when you say everybody\u2019s equal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo ensure transparency on our side, we let the new acquisition prospects, Solvemate and Miuros, have an interview with the first company we acquired without any presence from anyone from Dixa. They then could have a\u00a0<b>founder-to-founder interview<\/b>\u00a0on how it is to be acquired and ask any questions they might have.\u201d<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Cultural due-diligence&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p><i>Since cultural incompatibility is considered one of the primary causes for failed mergers, it correspondingly has a central role in facilitating a successful one. It\u2019s also an aspect Dixa has been laser-focused on.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe do a heavy culture due diligence which I\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. The financial numbers are whatever they are; the acquisition targets are such small companies that it\u2019s their future that counts and you cannot read into the numbers necessarily. That\u2019s why we spent significantly more time on culture than we did on financial numbers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>What are the cultural synergies to look out for?<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Chemistry.\u00a0<\/b>\u201cThe first cultural key for us is chemistry. Do you believe in these people when meeting with them, having worked with them previously? Can they do the right things at the right time when needed? Could we see them get into groupthink or other harmful modes of thinking?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Goal alignment.\u00a0<\/b>\u201cEqually important is goal alignment. When we bought the chatbot provider Solvemate, we fell in love with a line in their sales material: \u201cchatbots suck.\u201d Who on earth wants to talk to a chatbot? However, most people would rather have the answer from a chatbot than pick up the phone and call \u2013 that\u2019s even more annoying. That was our starting point. We aligned on the idea that this is an efficiency tool. So then how can we innovate this further and become smarter? For example, could we further integrate chatbots into customers\u2019 daily routines? Improve their memory? Or reduce repetition in their responses? These are the kind of questions we\u2019ll be posing as we evolve the product.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-upper-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p><i>The talent assessment is not about assessing what the employees\u2019 strengths or weaknesses are.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf the founders believe these are the right people to do these tasks, they know better than we do. We have made a ton of promotions from the recent acquisitions. For example, we promoted the CEO of both of the newly acquired companies to VPs. The CMO from one of the companies became the VP of Marketing for all companies and brands in the Dixa group.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Instead, the point of talent assessment is to identify any potential people-related bottlenecks.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe talent assessment focuses on asking how these people would play together with us. Are there any conflicts we can foresee? Are there any obstacles we need to be very aware of? Are there any strong personalities? Cultural influences that need to be taken into account? We just bought a French, a German, and an Australian company while opening offices in the US \u2013 and we\u2019re from the Nordics. There are a lot of different cultural things to consider if we are to be in the same team. This has to be discussed upfront.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>With two-thirds of the preparation done before the acquisition legally begins, the actual acquisition becomes relatively standard and straightforward \u2013 led by the lawyers and advisors.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe do the classic approach: we draft a letter of intent and write that we would like to pay you X; this much in cash, this much in other components, shares, etc., if you achieve X, Y, Z.

Where are the flaws we didn\u2019t see? How do we make sure we speak as one team and solve these issues?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs I mentioned earlier, before an acquisition you have to base your analysis on two-thirds of the details. This means that, to some degree, you\u2019re relying on good faith, honesty, and transparency until you reach the post-acquisition phase. But if you\u2019ve thoroughly vetted people and culture, this stage should reveal what you already suspected.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Post-acquisition integration is a delicate<\/i>\u00a0<i>period in an acquisition, so having an internal team organize the process end-to-end works wonders.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I was leading all aspects in all three acquisitions, the process overall was coordinated by our VP of Strategy. The strategy team then owns the integration execution end-to-end,\u00a0 managing the work streams and finalizing the integration. We started small, and the more serious it got, the more people got involved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had our post-acquisition integration organized into three Ps \u2013 people, product, and profit, in that order of importance. We then had work streams in these:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>People<\/b>-related work streams pertain to things like how do we make sure we have the same contractual rights in our contracts? If Dixa has something everybody should have it; salaries, systems, anything concerning people.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Product<\/b>\u00a0is about how we actually integrate the acquired products.

Should we vet the engineers?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Profit<\/b>\u00a0concerns the targets for each of the companies merged together. How much do we anticipate to cross-sell or up-sell?

We want to make sure that they still want to be on the journey \u2013 A part of that is also making sure people don\u2019t leave. If the founders aren\u2019t happy, if the employees aren\u2019t happy, or if we don\u2019t have the right incentives in place, the merger will never work. Then we should have simply built the product ourselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things we did with new acquisitions was a\u00a0<b>founder-only forum<\/b>. It\u2019s their babies we\u2019re trying to put together into one collective group. It\u2019s not that they have specific decision-making power.

To ask for that degree of trust was probably the biggest challenge with the mergers.\u201d<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Lesson #3: Be clear on the status of acquired brands&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>A key question with mergers is what to do with an acquired brand once it has been integrated. Christian explains the decision-making process they had around keeping the brands functioning in their individual use cases.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe decided to keep standalone brands in all three companies. These were high-growth companies by themselves and we want to take advantage of that, to get that revenue and those sales.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe way we describe it is that Dixa is purple, Elevio is green, Solvemate is blue, Miuros is yellow \u2013 and we like rainbows. We are trying to sell rainbows all the time. But it\u2019s okay if a rainbow starts with one color. We have intentionally kept the brands separate because they can team up with a Dixa competitor and do a sale with companies that for whatever reason don\u2019t like Dixa, aren\u2019t ready for Dixa or we\u2019re not ready for them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow, whenever we or they are ready and want them to join us, we already have a relationship with them and the know-how of how they do things. In Danish, you would say we are playing on all horses for a race. We don\u2019t care which one wins, as long as we are all aligned eventually.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStrategies like this can evolve over time so we\u2019ll keep the \u2018rainbow\u2019 sales process as long as it makes sense for our strategy and objectives.\u201d<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;When to say no to an acquisition&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>In the perfect acquisition world, culture, price, and vision come together in the perfect marriage of one stronger company. In reality, expectations aren\u2019t always aligned. Managing expectations and understanding founder motivations is critical to ensuring success.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes you cannot agree on a price or terms. Or maybe the tech wasn\u2019t exactly what you thought it was, or the people had some sides you hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur main focus has been on teams that want to buy into the bigger journey together. Because if you just want the money, then the acquisition journey is not going to be fun. For us, founders must be able to see themselves in Dixa for the foreseeable future. We told all the companies we considered for an acquisition that if you want to pursue a standalone route, that\u2019s fine, you should do that. We would be happy to be a reference case for how great you are \u2013 but then you should go for a normal funding round.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_color=&#8221;#fafafa&#8221; full_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; sticky_row=&#8221;true&#8221; sticky_row_alignment=&#8221;top&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; class=&#8221;article&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221; shape_type=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; left_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; constrain_group_2=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_backdrop_filter=&#8221;none&#8221; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;static&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; column_padding_type=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_position=&#8221;default&#8221; row_position_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; row_position_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; pointer_events=&#8221;all&#8221;][vc_column_inner left_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; constrain_group_101=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; left_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_103=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; left_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_105=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/slush.org\/when-startups-buy-startups-a-story-of-acquisitions\/\">&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Read more about: When Startups Buy Startups: A Story of Acquisitions &nbsp;&raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":2818,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[35,60],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2812"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2812"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2812\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3071,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2812\/revisions\/3071"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2818"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2812"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2812"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2812"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
