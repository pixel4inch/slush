It\u2019s for people who want to create and manage documents and project manage things. We see general use cases like someone organizing a team, but also engineering teams using it for tasks, and HR teams using it to onboard everyone in their company.

I don\u2019t code and I\u2019m not an engineer. That doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m a second-class citizen, it just means that I have other things to contribute.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>As such, Notion is sometimes categorized as\u00a0 \u2018product-led\u2019 since the strong product is central to customer acquisition. Olivia sees more nuance to this:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FjavQiln7J0\">Notion being a\u00a0<b><i>community-led company<\/i><\/b>\u00a0is what enables our organic growth.<\/a>\u00a0Notion is product-led in the sense that it is a beautiful product, but one that is anchored in the community we lean into.

We reached out to them and created a community to bring those people together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>The next step was getting to the bottom of what it was that made these users so excited about Notion and what they were trying to accomplish with it.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf someone tweeted about Notion we made sure to retweet it, send out emails, and connect with these ambassadors in a way that was pretty differentiated.

We keep tight service-level agreements, we get back to people in short timeframes, and make sure that they can contact us no matter what day of the week.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>For Olivia, ensuring that the growth funnel\u2019s middle section is secure is integral for sustaining the community and organic growth as a whole. The feedback loops with existing users help retain onboarded customers whilst also potentially introducing new members.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cEngaging with your existing customers is important, and that extends to acquiring new customers: they\u2019re very much connected. If you have happy existing customers, that helps you acquire new customers\u2026 You must assume that every customer is gold. Never assume that they\u2019re just going to stay with you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>So what\u2019s Olivia\u2019s key to ensuring existing customers remain happy?

That will continue. Knowing that, leaning into social media is a way to make sure people are hearing from each other about your product.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This is how Notion has put social media to use:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#1: Use social media to ensure users\u2019 continued investment in your product<a id=\"snapvestment\"><\/a><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><i>To increase user interaction, companies should use social media for direct customer engagement. Notion saw this as the best method to ensure their members could continue to be invested in the product.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNotion uses social media as a tool for constantly engaging with the people present there, giving them information about the product, providing access to roadmaps and the like. We intentionally make sure they have access and answers to all their questions to enable them to be out in front, building a platform and business for themselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#2: Save money by helping users solve their own problems<a id=\"metasavings\"><\/a><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><i>Giving information upfront, empowers community members to proactively generate content, solutions, and marketing to a larger and wider extent than through internal marketing. This effect is compounded in Notion due to its role as a tool provider. Giving people the tools to succeed and deal with potential issues from the outset in return creates savings for the company.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b><a id=\"CXeddit\"><\/a>#3: Use discussion forums as your CX research team<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><i>Leveraging value out of your community also extends to the feedback given through various channels that allows tailoring of the product to the users\u2019 wishes.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe beauty of the uncurated forums on Reddit, Facebook groups, and the like discussing Notion are that they actually voice what your customers would like to see about the product.

This stage is about exposing people to your product, making them fall in love with it, and getting them to talk to others about it. That\u2019s worked incredibly well for Notion. At some point, however, you start growing at a pace where you realize that to keep that pace of growth, you\u2019re going to have to supplement it with some sort of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UCQAZGS8rfU\">performance marketing<\/a>. That\u2019s natural.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>Being community-led changes the dynamic of performance marketing, effectively becoming an addition to the growth funnel instead of a separate strategy. By balancing both methods you are likely to see more efficient results.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like adding fuel to the fire that\u2019s already going. It\u2019s not an either or.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>The balance of how much marketing is really important as well. The movement away from pure organic growth requires staying even closer to your ethos to retain your existing users:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn this day and age\u00a0<b>being genuine is far more valuable for a brand than being perfect<\/b>.
