It also ensures I get through tasks that feel boring, tedious or laborious.<\/p>\n<p>This is a trait that is undervalued among CEOs. A lot of founders are very focused on being visionary and charismatic, when what actually matters is setting the tempo of the company and holding people accountable to their commitments.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#4: What important traits have you had to cultivate?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>Verbal communication<\/strong>, both 1-on-1 and in public forums. Before Spring Health, I had never talked a lot because it\u2019s not my natural element. I don\u2019t like processing thoughts verbally. Starting out as a CEO, I struggled to express myself coherently and fluidly. After some time, it became a lot more natural. These days, I would say I\u2019m very good at speaking because it\u2019s literally what my entire days are filled with.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seeing the glass half full<\/strong>. Frank Slootman of Snowflake once said: \u201cterror is a normal state for a CEO at all times\u201d. I\u2019m very much like that. My whole life, I\u2019ve been fuelled by paranoia and fear. I have a tendency to be very critical of myself and everything around me.<\/p>\n<p>When leading a company, this is a double-edged sword. On one hand, we should be paranoid about the state of mental healthcare today. A healthy level of paranoia allows us to improve all the time, approach our work with a sense of urgency, and address important problems early on. On the other hand, most people are not motivated by paranoia. Rather, they need a very clear articulation of where we\u2019re headed; a North Star. Over time, I\u2019ve had to build discipline around celebrating positives and approaching the future with a certain optimism.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#5: What do founders spend too much time on early on?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>PR<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 this is an easy one, and a mistake that we made. When you don\u2019t yet have a real business, no one cares, and you should just focus on execution.

VP this or SVP this is artificial and meaningless at 10 people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Office decor, swag, and business cards.<\/strong>\u00a0None of that stuff matters in the beginning, it\u2019s just a waste of time and resources.

Instead, I\u2019ll make sure we uncover a good answer.<\/p>\n<p>First, I try to understand why there are none. Are the available answers genuinely bad, or do they just feel painful? Humans are inherently averse to pain. A lot of founder CEOs fail because they avoid pain and therefore avoid making the right decision. If something feels painful, it\u2019s a great signal that I should force myself to confront it.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if there truly aren\u2019t any good answers, that\u2019s cause to look deeper. What happens quite a bit is we\u2019ll be brainstorming big bold bets for the company for the next year. My team will generate a list and nothing will feel fundamentally innovative.

Those three are non-negotiable. Anything else I\u2019ll delegate.<\/p>\n<p>To give you an example, individual compensation decisions are pretty straightforward so I should delegate them, and I have. However, the framework within which that is done needs to be approved by me because I need it to be aligned with our strategy and values.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#8: When you need your whole company to understand something, how do you communicate it?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]In every single medium, because people have very different preferences when it comes to communication. Some people need to hear stuff said out loud in all-hands, some internalize things best in 1-on-1s, and others are very visual learners. When something is very important, we really try to go through the list of possible media and utilize every single one.<\/p>\n<p>For me, communicating and receiving things in writing comes very naturally, and it took me very long to understand that most people won\u2019t read long memos. That said, memos are very good for:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Historical documentation<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Clarifying your own thinking<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Helping a group pick apart arguments and make better decisions<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>However, as a medium for announcements or communication, memos are the worst possible option.

CEOs who are obsessed with themselves or the role of \u201cCEO\u201d are a recipe for disaster.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Long-term thinking<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 exceptional founders actively push themselves to build foundations that are going to outlive them.
