Although he\u2019s had a fascination for programming from an early age, this has gone hand in hand with his passion for music and culture, which defined his early career steps.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started programming at the age of 10, on a Commodore 64 and found it magical to be able to show things on the screen. That was the first interaction with programming and the start of a self-learning journey. However, I studied Musicology and Comparative Literature at university and started working as a Music Journalist in Copenhagen before moving to Madrid, Spain. It was in Madrid that I started working as a developer for a startup.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>One thing that really stands out in Netlify\u2019s story is the curiosity and keen observation in finding the friction in the development process and trying to remove it. This revelation came to Matt while working as a senior developer, and eventually the CTO, of a startup.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe company was building websites for small to medium businesses throughout Europe. I was leading the teams from initial brief to production hosting. During that process I realized that we were building several iterations of the platform over and over again \u2013 so why not create a cloud platform that other developers can also use to build websites for their clients efficiently?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This became that pivotal moment of identifying the problem to solve at the heart of any startup journey.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was working on the idea I began to notice a fundamental shift in the architecture of the web, from being one big monolithic application to a world where we would spin off the web UI layer into its own thing and the backend services into a separate entity, what we coined as the Jamstack architecture. That became the start of Netlify.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Building the company through Build-Measure-Learn&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>Matt is certainly an advocate of the build-measure-learn approach of iteration through launching\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/6-best-product-lessons-from-slush-stages\/#Lesson%20#3:%20MVPs%20%E2%80%93%20be%20clear%20about%20what%20you're%20testing%20and%20when%20you%20should%20test%20it\"><i>MVPs<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i>\u00a0<i>In the early days, for Matt the \u2018launch as early as possible and then iterate\u2019 made sense<\/i>\u00a0<i>as not only did they validate the idea and give valuable feedback, but also ended up coming on board in different shapes and forms.\u00a0<\/i><i>\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was ruthlessly pragmatic about shipping all the time. From the get-go I gave myself tight deadlines to first build the MVP and then add further functionalities to it. The idea was to get the product out there in front of people, followed by iterative enhancement of the product since then.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>But how did they actually obtain the valuable feedback needed for the iteration process? Getting people onboard to a new concept is a challenge in itself but, Matt and his Co-founder Christian Bach had a plan for handling this delicate situation \u2013 especially in the web development line of work it\u2019s all about getting the product to the most relevant early adopters to create a ripple effect.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cChris and I spent a lot of time coming up with a plan on how to popularize our new concept and get it in front of the right people. We made a list of 20 people that we thought would be perfect to get an opinion from. Because most of these things spread in concentric circles where you have these very early pioneers, then they evangelize it in the circle around them, and then it spreads and goes further out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>Obviously, it wasn\u2019t just about spreading the idea, but also seeing whether it was even worth pursuing further in the first place.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had this plan that we need to get it in front of these 20 people or as many of them as we can, and at least half of them need to believe that we are onto something and will adopt it. If we can\u2019t build something that they think is appealing, then we\u2019re probably not even on the right course.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>As it turned out, such a test can also have the unintended impact of getting people on board, as it did for Matt and Chris.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cFortunately, as we went through that list and got in front of people, some of them became customers, some of them became investors, and today, a couple of them are even employees. We got a lot of proof that we had something of value.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n<h4><strong>Founder &amp; Early Investor: I\u2019ll be there for you<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h5><strong>Mathias Biilmann (Netlify) &amp; Bucky Moore (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kleinerperkins.com\/\">Kleiner Perkins<\/a>) <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7YXZ8yPn8QI\">HERE<\/a>.<\/strong><\/h5>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;What makes an exceptional Founder-CEO?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<h4><b>#1: Building a company vs building a product<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><i>One of the thematic focal points at Slush 2021 was on the importance of capturing the founder potential across different disciplines and walks of life; Matt is a great example of a founder whose slightly different road taken has paved the way to his success.<\/i>\u00a0<i>For him the oftentimes cumbersome transition from technical founder to CEO was never an issue due to his rather unique background in the humanities.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was a technical founder but, on the other hand when I went to university I studied people and culture, and how to help people make sense of the world. I think for some technical founders, it\u2019s challenging because what they\u2019re passionate about is primarily technology.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>On the other hand, for Matt the detail of technology has always gone hand in hand with the bigger picture of the company.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love building technology. I think it\u2019s immensely fun, but I also really like the idea of company building.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This was also something that was ingrained in his brain from the beginning, helping to make sense of the relationship between company and product from the start.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cVery early on, I was bombarded with the phrase \u2018a product is not a company\u2019. I think it really helped me to get to that point of understanding from the beginning that what we were building was a company\u00a0<i>that<\/i>\u00a0built a product. In the beginning, that company was just me building the product; but as we scaled, it became an organization that\u2019s structured around building the right kind of product for the problem being solved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#2: Have the ability to zoom in and zoom out<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><i>Matt thinks it\u2019s important for everyone to start thinking about the company from the beginning. Since much may be hanging by a thread in the early stages, and it\u2019s crucial to build the product, this may seem counterintuitive. Yet Matt doesn\u2019t mean that you have to have detailed business and pricing models set \u2013 as these are bound to be subject to change \u2013 but that you should keep the bigger vision keenly in mind.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cEspecially once you get to the point where you start needing to raise money, or hire people, you really need to start thinking about what company are you building, not just what product. You have to be able to articulate, ideally, what that company will look like when it\u2019s grown up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This all ties into one of the foremost qualities Matt thinks exceptional founders should have: the ability to both zoom in and zoom out.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cFounders need to have the constant urge to look at how to tackle the next set of problems, while looking at the bigger picture and really focusing on building a company and a culture of people that can solve the problem which you\u2019ve set out to solve. This with the drive to keep moving forward and the constant realization that every milestone achieved is the beginning of a new journey are at the cornerstones of being a successful founder.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#3: Learn when to delegate, and where to be flexible<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><i>This goes hand in hand with the ability to delegate and let go. The role of a Founder CEO changes drastically throughout a startup\u2019s life cycle, posing different challenges at each phase \u2013 the skill to choose your battles wisely goes a long way at any stage.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNaturally, as a founder you will constantly be pulled into day-to-day pieces of operations of the business that seem super important at the time, and sometimes they really are. Yet, you have to find ways to push away excess, to have the surplus time to focus on what the broader solution is instead of solving all the individual things.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>You also need to be brutally honest with yourself about where you\u2019re adding value and where you aren\u2019t.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the early stages, you can\u2019t just push all of it away, but you have to try to minimize the time you spend on things where you as a founder really doesn\u2019t add any differentiated value \u2013 if I\u2019m spending my time there, then I\u2019m probably not spending my time in an area where I actually could make a bigger difference compared to someone else.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>It comes back to knowing when to be flexible, and Matt has a neat rule of thumb for how to strike this balance.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cBe inflexible on the broad vision and flexible on everything else.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Netlify\u2019s future: building a healthy jamstack ecosystem&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>Having seized the moment of seismic change in web development to their advantage, Netlify is looking to grow even further, while advancing the whole Jamstack ecosystem alongside.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNetlify has benefited from the fortunate situation of being in the right place at the right time. Now it\u2019s becoming obvious that this decoupling architectural shift is happening, and it\u2019s only going to accelerate further. Therefore the market is becoming very competitive.
