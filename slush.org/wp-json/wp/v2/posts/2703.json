When designing any product, the starting question should be what problem the product is solving. According to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intercom.com\/\">Intercom<\/a>\u2018s Des Traynor, the constant in the product equation is human needs: \u201cFor as long as people have existed, we\u2019ve wanted to write long boring stories. In the old days, we would hire people to write them on scrolls. Today, we write them on Medium\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><b>Use technology to streamline the process of responding to the need.\u00a0<\/b>Twitter Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey echoes the human need-perspective: \u201ctake a human desire that has been around for a long time and use modern technology to take out steps.\u201d\u00a0If you look at the most successful tech companies \u2013 particularly in the consumer space \u2013 they are perennially taking the same human needs and solving them through emerging technologies. As\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/tinder.com\/\">Tinder<\/a>\u2019s former VP Product Ankur Jain notes, in their case, that happened to be mobile, but ten years ago, there was a different version of Tinder.<\/p>\n<p><b>Focus on product fluidity in solving the problem, word of mouth will follow.\u00a0<\/b>The core question to ask yourself is this: \u201cDoes this new technology make it cheaper, faster, or easier for our customers to make progress in their lives?\u201d Tinder\u2019s Chief Product Officer Brian Norgard emphasizes simplicity especially in the beginning. After identifying the need, focus on building a great, fluid, and simple product first \u2013 this will help you get word of mouth working to your advantage. Word of mouth is much higher if you reduce the friction inherent in solving a core human need than if you try to create a problem for your product to solve. The ideal situation\u00a0you should get to is producing the \u2018wrist twist\u2019-effect: making a product so addictive and fun that people would quite literally twist their friend\u2019s wrist to make them look at it.<\/p>\n<p><b>Let your product evolve with the times \u2013 don\u2019t fall in love with your solution.\u00a0<\/b>Des Traynor contends that tectonic shifts in the tech space show just why you need to fall in love with your product, not your solution. Telecoms were obsessed with the idea that they are SMS companies that exist to send SMSs. When Whatsapp came along and solved the underlying need, \u201chelp me connect with my friends\u201d much better, the global SMS infrastructure got annihilated in the space of three years.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h7LBVxdX1jQ\">Lessons from Tinder: Building a Product That 10 Million People Use Daily<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8PT40bNEKtM&amp;t\">Keeping Your Product Relevant by Des Traynor<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Lesson #2: Put the human at the center of product development \u2013 use psychology to your advantage&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>Using cognitive science and psychology in UX.\u00a0<\/strong>Ultimately, how users experience your product takes place in their minds. The important takeaway is this: human brains don\u2019t work rationally and systematically \u2013 you need to design products for our sometimes irrational and disorderly brains. As\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.epicgames.com\/site\/en-US\/home\">Fortnite<\/a>\u00a0Game UX Consultant Celia Hodent showcased\u00a0at Slush 2019, we\u2019re guided and limited by our perception, memory, and attention; three things you should keep in mind when designing your product.<\/p>\n<p>perception=subjective<\/p>\n<p>attention=scarce<\/p>\n<p>memory=fallible<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b><i>Perception<\/i><\/b><i>.\u00a0 As a construct of the mind, our perception is by nature subjective. It depends on prior knowledge and changes depending on the context. It isn\u2019t therefore certain that what you intend for a product, in Fortnite\u2019s case, a game, is what people are going to see. This is why you need to test early on.\u00a0<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b><i>Memory<\/i><\/b><i>. Memory is fallible and ultimately an inaccurate reconstruction. We also forget a bunch of stuff \u2013 alleviating memory load is therefore an essential feature in a product.<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b><i>Attention.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><i>Attention is scarce, so it is crucial to pace out changes so that they aren\u2019t overwhelming.\u00a0<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Keeping these limitations in mind, Fortnite has designed its games with the framework:<\/p>\n<p><b>Game UX= Usability + Engage-ability.\u00a0<\/b>Here usability refers to people understanding the goal and what they need to be doing. On the other hand, engage-ability relates to the motivations users have to play the game and learn the things that need to be learned to play and master it.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2705&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<h5><b>Harnessing intrinsic motivation<\/b><\/h5>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/superhuman.com\/\">Superhuman<\/a>\u2019s CEO and Founder Rahul Vohra has been thinking along the same lines; they have deliberately employed game design principles in their product, to tap into human motivation and help business software feel like play. Roughly speaking, human motivation can be divided into two categories, intrinsic and extrinsic. The latter refers to the kind that essentially depends on earning rewards. But as it happens, creating extrinsic reward structures tends to undermine intrinsic motivation.<\/p>\n<p><b>The critical thing to focus on then is\u00a0<\/b><b><i>intrinsic motivation<\/i><\/b><b>, which is why Vohra argues that we should focus on game design rather than\u00a0<\/b><b><i>gamification<\/i><\/b><b>.\u00a0<\/b>He shared five key factors in game design; goals, emotions, controls, toys, and flow. From these, he drew seven lessons we should use to tap into intrinsic motivation and make truly great products.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>1. Goals<\/b>: A defining feature of games; need to be concrete (clear inbox), achievable (onboarding and teaching shortcuts), and rewarding (inbox zero=a sense of triumph)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lesson 1: Create goals that are concrete, achievable, and rewarding<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Emotions<\/b>: Best games create strong emotions, as they are the foundation of our memory. To do this, you need to be able to analyze emotions, and you need a vocabulary for them. One of Rahul\u2019s examples of such tools was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/simplish.co\/blog\/plutchiks-emotion-wheel\">Plutchick\u2019s wheel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lesson 2: Design for nuanced emotions\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>3. Controls<\/b>: Controls can be the #1 reason why a game succeeds. The idea of video game controls is to make them feel seamless so that you can drive them as hard and as fast as you want to without the motion breaking.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lesson 3: Design controls that aren\u2019t just rapid but also robust<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>4. Toys<\/b>: Best games are built out of toys because then they are fun on multiple levels: both at the level of the toy as well as at the level of the game itself. With Superhuman, the toy is the time auto-completer, which is fun because it encourages playful exploration.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lesson 4: Create fun toys and then assemble them into games<br \/>\n<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>5. Flow<\/b>:<\/p>\n<p><i>\u201cFlow is a state of mind, intense and focused concentration on the present. It is so absorbing that we don\u2019t worry about the past or think about the future; it is so demanding that we don\u2019t care about what others think about us; it is so easy that we always know what to do next; it is so powerful that it alters our subjective experience of time; time can either flash by in an instant or stretch out to infinity. Flow is so rewarding that our activities become intrinsically motivating \u2013 the most powerful and effective form of motivation\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>How do you create\u00a0flow? Conditions: 1) users must always know what to do next 2) they must always know how to do it 3) users must be free from distractions because disruptions take away from our attention 4) users need clear and immediate feedback 5) users must feel a balance between high-perceived skill and high-perceived challenge \u2013 neither too high nor too low, which means that sometimes we have to make the goals of our products harder to achieve.<b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lesson 5: Users must always know what to do next and how to do it\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lesson 6: Users must be free from distractions and receive clear and immediate feedback\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lesson 7: Balance high-perceived skill with high-perceived talent<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=787fMmQbnBc&amp;t\">The Success of Fortnite: A Psychology and UX Perspective<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CsP2WAkPcQQ\">Fireside Chat with the Founder &amp; CEO of Superhuman<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Lesson #3: MVPs \u2013 be clear about what you\u2019re testing and when you should test it&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;It\u2019s good to get a feel of how people react to your product \u2013 even if the feedback is negative, it will help you build a better product.&#8221; name=&#8221;Edith Harbaugh&#8221; subtitle=&#8221;CEO and Co-founder of LaunchDarkly&#8221;][vc_column_text]As the concept of minimum viable product (MVP) has been popularized with the emergence of the lean startup movement, one question often comes up: should you keep your secrets safe or build out in the open?\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/launchdarkly.com\/\">LaunchDarkly<\/a>\u2019s Edith Harbaugh doesn\u2019t think you should build your product in stealth mode, but to tell everyone about your product and find\u00a0<i>anyone<\/i>\u00a0who could be interested in trying it out. And any kind of reaction is a better reaction than indifference, according to Chad Fowler, former General Manager for Startups at Microsoft: \u201cCreating something people hate is much better than creating something people don\u2019t really care about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/varjo.com\/\">Varjo<\/a>\u2019s Tiina Nieminen describes building products as striking a tedious balance between perfection and time to market. Every step of the way, you should feel mildly embarrassed about what you\u2019ve created. No one tends to be completely happy with their end product: \u201cI\u2019m yet to meet a product person who\u2019s completely happy with the end product \u2013 this just means that your vision was bold enough, and along the way you managed to make tough trade-offs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>\u2026.But when launching an MVP, be deliberate about what you\u2019re testing.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Nieminen\u00a0is a strong proponent of failing fast to succeed sooner. Build a prototype as fast as you can, but be very deliberate about what you\u2019re trying to learn through a particular iteration. Whether you are building a mockup, a proof of concept (POC), or an MVP, this is important. Are you\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">\u2026trying to de-risk a core technology<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">\u2026building an MVP with your customers to get rid of noise and get clarity on what you should be doing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How much \u2018minimum\u2019 should there be in the MVP?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In other words, can you come out with a\u00a0<i>maximum\u00a0<\/i>viable product? While Harbaugh and Fowler think it\u2019s possible to come out with a massive launch, often you need at least some iterations. The feedback you gain from the build-measure-learn cycle is the fuel to the fire of the product development process (the good kind). Big launches may be better suited for making a big marketing splash \u2013 not necessarily optimal for product development.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>\u2026.nevertheless, your vision as a founder is what ultimately defines what \u2018level\u2019 of MVP is right for your product.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In 2012 when\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/\">Canva<\/a>\u00a0was making preparations for launching their product, they faced a lot of pressure from investors to put out an MVP as the lean startup movement was raging. But what is the minimal thing that you can put out that will be successful? Canva decided to take a whole year instead of the quite usual three or six months to polish their product into something that they knew was good enough for them. Whatever is MVP for you is particular to your product and market. While customer feedback is essential, you need to balance it with your vision \u2013 only you know when you\u2019re ready to launch an MVP and whether it will actually be helpful to you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Launching an MVP is an excellent way to iterate, but it is not the only one. You can also work on smaller iterations without launching the product.

In terms of revenue (for SaaS companies specifically), this point in the startup journey is usually associated with the \u2018impossible\u2019 stage from 0-1M in revenue \u2013 where around 80% of startups fail.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/screencloud-journey\/8-things-that-will-definitely-happen-as-you-scale-your-saas-business-from-0-1m-f42aa7c37be0\">0-1M\u2026impossible<\/a>; 0-1M\u00a0 is the impossible stretch because that\u2019s the P\/M fit stage where 80% or more companies fail.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/screencloud-journey\/8-things-that-will-definitely-happen-as-you-scale-your-saas-business-from-0-1m-f42aa7c37be0\">1-10M\u2026improbable<\/a>; 1-10M is a brutal grind for founders, you have real customers, but you can\u2019t yet hire a world-class executive team.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/screencloud-journey\/8-things-that-will-definitely-happen-as-you-scale-your-saas-business-from-0-1m-f42aa7c37be0\">10-100M\u2026inevitable<\/a>;\u00a0By the time you get to 10M, you\u2019ll have so much momentum behind you that you\u2019re going to make it eventually.<\/p>\n<p>The questions that startup founders constantly ask themselves are: 1) how do you reach P\/M fit and 2) how do you know you\u2019ve actually reached it? Here\u2019s what\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/segment.com\/\">Segment<\/a>\u2019s Peter Reinhardt had to say.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>You need to be a cockroach when searching for P\/M fit\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Being a cockroach doesn\u2019t sound too appealing? What this means is that you need to maximize your shots on target. Be frugal to stretch your runway and have more space to test as many ideas as possible to move yet another inch closer to the iteration that paves your way to success. Build, launch, and test several product ideas \u2013 improve the odds as much as possible.\u00a0<b>Some notions:\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>P\/M fit is encoded in success, not failure.\u00a0<\/b>Here the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=21WaxCKksqw\">traditional wisdom<\/a>\u00a0doesn\u2019t necessarily hold \u2013 to succeed, you needn\u2019t fail. In fact, according to Reinhardt, succeeding at finding P\/M fit once improves your chances from 22% to 34%, whereas failing has no such impact.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>You need to know how to throw away failures fast enough.<\/b>\u00a0Segment had two major ideas before they actually discovered their holy-grail-iteration by accident.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Don\u2019t get too attached to your initial idea.\u00a0<\/b>The product that finally carries you to success might be something completely different from what you envisioned initially.

According to Reinhardt, every single thing in your business goes crazy. Rather than just surviving, P\/M fit suddenly makes everything easier. People suddenly want to work for you; customers want to help your company; investors care; your focus as a founder shifts from P\/M fit to go-to-market growth. As Reinhardt would put it, P\/M fit turns you from a cockroach into a uniroach:<\/p>\n<p><i>\u201cProduct-market fit doesn\u2019t feel like idle interest; it doesn\u2019t feel like a glimmer of hope from a random conversation with a prospect. It feels like everything in your business is suddenly going haywire, it feels like a proud rush of adrenaline that people actually care, it feels like actually a little bit of a loss of control because customers are telling you what they want, and it\u2019s no longer necessarily as much about your vision\u201d.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oP3YGG6ECbs\">Segment\u2019s Bumpy Road to Product-Market Fit with Co-founder &amp; CEO Peter Reinhardt<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">For some extra insight on Product-Market Fit:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rmpU9eeroXk&amp;\">Rahul Vohra, CEO of Superhuman | Mastering Product-Market Fit #12<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Lesson #5: Designing customer onboarding success&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;Customer onboarding might just be your most important growth strategy&#8221; name=&#8221;Casey Winters&#8221; subtitle=&#8221;Chief Product Officer at Eventbrite&#8221;][vc_column_text]For most products, a plurality of churn happens at the very beginning; people try your product once and never come back. Because of this,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/\">Eventbrite<\/a>\u2018s Casey Winters contends that, for a lot of companies, improving customer onboarding is the most significant individual driver of user retention. Because those retained users are prone to bring on others, onboarding may just be your most important driver of acquisition as well. \u201cMost scalable strategies for acquiring new users have to do with retained users bringing on others,\u201d Casey says. \u201cEither they tell other people, and the product goes viral, or they create content that you can distribute.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Onboarding was similarly key to Canva\u2019s success, according to their Co-founder Cameron Adams. Since their users weren\u2019t designers themselves, they could be wary of making changes in the design. Effective onboarding was crucial in giving users the confidence in their abilities and the courage to use the software \u2013 after all, you can\u2019t get your users hooked on your product if they\u2019re too afraid to use it.<\/p>\n<p>So, how do you actually design an onboarding process?<\/p>\n<p>According to Casey, your users are in the onboarding phase until they\u2019ve formed a habit out of using your product. Take an initial cohort of users and follow it over time. The point at which you stop losing people from the cohort is your \u2018habit moment\u2019. To get to it, you need to figure out three things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Key action\u00a0<\/b>\u2013 what is the user action that best correlates with a user realizing they\u2019ve received value from your product?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Designated frequency<\/b>\u00a0\u2013 how often will a user want to receive that value?<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Retention interval\u00a0<\/b>\u2013 how many times does a user need to complete the key action at the designated frequency for them to form a habit?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DrmgZLj1zfo\">Casey Winters: Why Customer Onboarding is the Most Crucial Part of Your Growth Strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tgWlj64DFPE\">Product Journey of Canva by CPO &amp; Co-founder Cameron Adams<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2706&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Lesson #6: How to make people fall in love with your community&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;As an entrepreneur, you should be a community-builder first&#8221; name=&#8221;Eros Resmini&#8221; subtitle=&#8221;Former CMO at Discord&#8221;][vc_column_text]<b>Onboarding alone may not be sufficient for retention and acquisition \u2013\u00a0<\/b>people need to not only fall in love with your product but also the community you\u2019re building. Creating a community and authentic relationships with your users can be a much more economical way to acquire and especially retain customers than pouring money into social media ads. Here are some keys to cracking the community building code:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>1. Back to MVP \u2013 start early:\u00a0<\/b>Community building starts before you even launch your product. You don\u2019t want to launch your product before it\u2019s ready, but it\u2019s also essential to get customers\u2019 sentiments well before you launch and start building a community from the day you have your idea. Creating your community around an MVP early on can attract your first superfans and get people talking about your product before you launch.<\/p>\n<p>This will naturally be dependent on the type of product you have \u2013 B2B companies,\u00a0<i>in general,\u00a0<\/i>may not have the same impetus for early community-building. There are notable exceptions, like Slack, however.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Importance of intuition and founder-product-community fit.<\/b>\u00a0If you\u2019re not already a part of the community you\u2019re building for, maybe you\u2019re building the wrong product.\u00a0Former\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/brand-new\">Discord<\/a>\u00a0CMO Eros Resmini emphasizes the importance of the \u2018founder-product-fit\u2019; if you\u2019ve experienced the problem or have passion for it, you\u2019re going to understand some nuance around solving the problem that others won\u2019t. This is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nfx.com\/post\/4-signs-founder-market-fit\/\">not a novel notion in itself\u00a0<\/a>\u2013 but can also be applied to the context of community building. Passion\u00a0provides the necessary intuition for community building, and also helps you put up with the messed-up times where someone else would rather throw in the towel.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Community intuition is crucial for eventually scaling community<\/b>\u00a0through more technical processes of defining KPIs and measuring them, hiring, and how to build teams to work on these questions. The focus is on scaling the community the founder already knows; while others can help with more technical aspects, community intuition is in the driver\u2019s seat. In the earlier stages, it can also be useful for the founder themself to actively take part in the community, especially if this is something that comes naturally to them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>3. Accelerating the growth of a small but promising budding community.\u00a0<\/b>The secret isn\u2019t more spending on ads, but maintaining the health of the community in a consistent way.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>3.1 Make sure your users have a good experience.\u00a0<\/b>If someone has a bad experience they won\u2019t come back \u2013 this will show in engagement metrics. An integral part of a good experience is community moderation.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><i>You should have a set of values that you operate by both internally and externally; these values should inform your community guidelines.\u00a0<\/i>Guidelines should be put in place early on, and it\u2019s good to get input from your key community members. This way you can avoid blindspots in the guidelines, and it helps you facilitate a sense of ownership that ensures you\u2019ll have advocates within the community when problems arise.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><i>Be consistent<\/i>\u00a0in how you address issues, and make sure you address the behavior and not the individual.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>3.2 Reward your community<\/b>, especially the members who are helping in building the community. Your super users spreading the word, moderating, or answering questions are supplementing the customer experience for everyone.<\/p>\n<p><b>3.3 Have fun with your users<\/b>. Today\u2019s consumer expects to have a relationship with the platform or product \u2013 get playful.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>4. When should you use paid acquisition rather than community building to grow?\u00a0<\/b>The balance between these two may vary not only between types of startups but also across growth stages. Resmini maintains that early on, paid acquisition is more suited to test what works, not to scale, which is better driven by organic community-based growth. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get into any meaningful level of paid advertising until year 5 of the company. Almost 100% of our growth was through organic community growth and influencers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Influencer marketing falls somewhere between traditional paid ads and community-building. For Discord, during initial growth, they observed organically that some influencers were using their product. Ultimately, they started collaborating with them. Why? It\u2019s important you get people who are genuinely in love with your product to talk about it to others. They\u2019ll be the ones who can give the best feedback that \u2018actually makes sense\u2019 and taps into more complex aspects of your product. This way, you can build business relations for the right reasons and with significant added value.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>5. How do you track the performance of your community-building online?\u00a0<\/b>Every company, community, platform, and team is different. Measuring performance therefore isn\u2019t simple, but you should be looking at metrics at the community level that make sense in the context of\u00a0<i>your<\/i>\u00a0business. You\u2019ll need these to build your own understanding and justify resource allocation to your investors as opposed to a simple conversation on ad spend. Then how do you determine what these metrics are?<\/p>\n<p><i>Look at engagement: What are your key interactions?<\/i>\u00a0You need to determine the most valuable interactions relative to the success of your product \u2013 whether that be users talking about product features, users talking to each other, users giving feedback, or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/review.firstround.com\/im-sorry-but-those-are-vanity-metrics\">something else<\/a>. Once you\u2019ve determined what these key interactions are, you can develop a spreadsheet math problem on what number of impressions is needed to be successful and how you can reach them within a set time frame.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/374912429\">Discord: Community Building for Customer Acquisition<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>For some more lessons join Slush on December 1-2, or if you\u2019d rather not wait,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/node-by-slush\/\">sign up<\/a>\u00a0for Node by Slush.<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221;
