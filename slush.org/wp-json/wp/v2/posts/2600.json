The underlying blockchain technology centers around guaranteeing trust for transactions and events without needing an intermediary. The removal of traditional banks, servers, administrators, and even governments that slow down technological progress excites people. And this technology is only around 15 years old \u2013 there are so many improvements to be made.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This is backed by the data. Bitcoin alone has hosted over\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/research-bitcoin-has-over-1-billion-unique-addresses-leaving-eth-ltc-in-the-dust\/\">1 billion unique internet addresses<\/a>.

Some of the most successful companies of the past two decades such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have earned this position through their monopoly on internet infrastructure and the data flowing through it. The ability to change this narrative, to build something of your own, and to have monetary and actual ownership of your data and digital creations is the cornerstone for the next generation of Web3 builders.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Here are our 45 most essential Web 3.0 terms you need to know to get started.<\/em>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n<h4><b>AMM<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"AMM\"><\/a>AMM stands for Automated Market Maker.<\/p>\n<p>In traditional finance, normal market makers determine the price of a stock in a given transaction. Typically, when a party states the price you are willing to sell an asset, a broker will connect you to a buyer willing to buy your asset. This broker can then set the actual price of the exchange, typically the midpoint price, and can add any fees they want to this service.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, an AMM automates this process in\u00a0<strong>cryptocurrency<\/strong>\u00a0transactions by creating connected liquidity pools made up of the two currencies being exchanged at that moment. The price set for exchange between these two pools is dictated by the ratio of these paired\u00a0<strong>tokens<\/strong>\u00a0between the two pools\u00a0\u2013 no broker is needed to determine the price. This is fully automated through the use of algorithms such as\u00a0<b>smart contracts\u00a0<\/b>to isolate the exact amount wanted if somebody is buying or selling through an AMM \u2014 referred to as AMM protocols. Examples include\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/uniswap.org\/\">Uniswap<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sushi.com\/\">Sushiswap<\/a>, which raise the tokens for their pools by offering a cut of transaction fees to people who\u00a0<b>stake\u00a0<\/b>and lock up their tokens in these AMM pools.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Airdrop<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"Airdrop\"><\/a>Airdropping is the placing of\u00a0<b>tokens\u00a0<\/b>directly into interested parties\u2019\u00a0<b>wallets<\/b>. This can be done as a marketing tool as an incentive scheme It is also can be used to correct fraudulent changes in tokens.<\/p>\n<p>Famous airdrops include the crypto wallet\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/brd.com\/\">BRD<\/a>\u2019s bread token that maxed out signups after two hours or uniswap giving 15% of its governance\u00a0tokens\u00a0to early adopters as thanks and to give them a greater say in its future direction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Bitcoin<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"bitcoin\"><\/a>Bitcoin (BTC) started in 2009 as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d based on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/bitcoin.pdf\">Satoshi Nakamoto white paper<\/a>\u00a0and is built using\u00a0<b>blockchain<\/b>\u00a0technology. It is the most popular\u00a0<b>cryptocurrency\u00a0<\/b>with a current total market cap of \u20ac380B at the time of publishing.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin has two main features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Each bitcoin is \u2018<b>mined.<\/b>\u2019 To mine a bitcoin, a user provides their computer (or data center) to verify other people\u2019s Bitcoin transactions. Mining thus means that the miner is being rewarded in Bitcoin in exchange for verifying transactions \u2014 the\u00a0<b>proof of work<\/b><strong>(PoW)<\/strong>\u00a0verification method.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Bitcoin is coded in a way that there can only be 21M bitcoin mined. The more Bitcoin mined, the smaller these verification rewards become. Over<a href=\"https:\/\/buybitcoinworldwide.com\/how-many-bitcoins-are-there\/\">\u00a090% of the total Bitcoin supply<\/a>\u00a0has been mined at the time of publishing. At the current pace, the last bitcoin is predicted to be mined in 2140.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The process of verification is expensive in terms of the energy required. However, this makes Bitcoin transactions more secure compared to many other\u00a0cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>The vision outlined in the white paper is for Bitcoin to become a currency used for everyday transactions. However, it has not gained widespread popularity as a means of payment in everyday life relative to the popularity of\u00a0<strong>fiat<\/strong>\u00a0currencies. Thus, Bitcoin\u2019s value mainly reflects investors\u2019 speculative feelings about its future worth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Block<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"block\"><\/a>A block is the digital storage of transactions on a\u00a0<strong>blockchain<\/strong>, which is connected to a history of every previous transaction before it, forming a chain of blocks<b>.\u00a0<\/b>Once these blocks are added to the chain they are considered immutable: they cannot be changed by an outside party. Blocks vary by size (amount of transactions stored) and speed (how fast the transactions take to be validated).<\/p>\n<p>To add a new block to a blockchain, a computer states the information to be put onto a block. Once this block is \u2018filled\u2019 with data, a validation method will occur to ensure the transactions are valid for the whole network, such as \u2018finding\u2019 one through\u00a0<b>mining\u00a0<\/b>in\u00a0<b>PoW<\/b>\u00a0algorithms. The transaction is not considered valid until each computer shows the same information as every other computer on the blockchain network. This is called reaching\u00a0<b>consensus<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Blockchain<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"bc\"><\/a>Blockchain technology is a method to guarantee an event on the internet without requiring verification from a third party like an internet server, bank, or the government. The blockchain itself is a digital record of transactions documented on\u00a0<b>blocks<\/b>. This record is copied across a decentralized network of computers where each computer is connected to one another instead of going through an internet server.<\/p>\n<p>The blocks are connected and immutable: once recorded on the blockchain, they cannot be changed by an outside party.\u00a0They are kept immutable due to decentralization, as each block must be identical on every single computer to be part of the blockchain. Having an identical copy of the blockchain on each verifying computer validates the transaction and is referred to as achieving\u00a0<b>consensus<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>Recording a transaction or event on a blockchain is significantly more secure and more transparent (the transaction history is forever on the blockchain) without requiring any third-party oversight. Blockchains vary by purpose, validation method, and transaction fees\u00a0<b>(gas fees)<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is the underlying basis for the majority of\u00a0<b>Web3<\/b>, as ownership of a project is attached to every contributor through connecting their computer to the blockchain. Blockchain\u2019s secure and strong verification features without a third party have seen the rise of\u00a0<b>smart contracts<\/b>\u00a0and\u00a0<b>DeFi<\/b>. Outside of the Web3 infrastructure, blockchain has for example been used in verifying the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brilliantearth.com\/\">authenticity of diamonds<\/a>\u00a0and in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/biserdimitrov\/2019\/12\/05\/how-walmart-and-others-are-riding-a-blockchain-wave-to-supply-chain-paradise\/\">speeding up supply chains<\/a>\u00a0for retail giants such as Walmart.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Bridge<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"bridge\"><\/a>A bridge is an application designed to allow the transaction of assets between two or more separate<b>\u00a0blockchains<\/b>, also referred to as \u201ccross-chain\u201d swapping.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers with\u00a0<strong>Bitcoin<\/strong>\u00a0for instance would use a bridge to access\u00a0<b>Ethereum<\/b>\u2019s<b>\u00a0smart contracts<\/b>\u00a0and services without selling their BTC for its ETH equivalent. This is a valuable feature, as selling and buying tokens can generate significant transaction costs (gas fees).<\/p>\n<p>Bridges compromise on security in exchange for cross-chain interoperability. Bridges tend to have small numbers of validators, making them vulnerable to attack, as seen with Axie Infinity\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/axie-infinitys-ronin-network-suffers-%e2%89%88625m-exploit-in-largest-defi-hack-to-date\/\">Ronin network hack<\/a>\u00a0in March 2022.

The blockchain is copied across the whole network of computers that have formed the blockchain through contributing individual\u00a0blocks. Consensus is the security requirement for these computers, named\u00a0<b>nodes<\/b>, to hold the identical version of the blockchain at the same time. Should a hacker want to tamper with a block on a blockchain, they would have to do so on every\u00a0node\u00a0for it to be successful.<\/p>\n<p>The two most common methods for a network to achieve consensus and validate data held on each node are the\u00a0<b>proof of work<\/b>\u00a0or\u00a0<b>proof of stake<\/b>\u00a0method.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Cryptocurrency<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"crypto\"><\/a>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency secured on a\u00a0<strong>blockchain<\/strong>.\u00a0<b>Bitcoin\u00a0<\/b>is the most common example of this. The blockchain uses cryptographic proof to secure the currency. This prevents the double spending issue for digital currencies where a currency unit is used for multiple payments without being used up. This is where the cryptocurrency name derives from. Anyone can make a cryptocurrency and they are regulated only by their underlying\u00a0<b>protocol\u00a0<\/b>or\u00a0<b>DAO<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>DAO<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"dao\"><\/a>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are an organizational structure used to run and oversee projects in\u00a0<b>Web3<\/b>\u00a0in a decentralized manner. Although some projects are run in a more traditional company structure, the importance of decentralization for many Web3 contributors has caused DAOs to become a more common structure.<\/p>\n<p>DAOs are constructed around the ideal of \u201cbottom-up governance\u201d:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Tokens<\/b>\u00a0or separately shared\u00a0<i>governance\u00a0<\/i>tokens give you voting rights like shares in a company.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">All voting procedures and mechanisms have been decided at the inception of the\u00a0<strong>blockchain<\/strong>\u00a0and are executed by\u00a0<b>smart contracts<\/b>.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ideally, there is no true leadership group. Anybody can submit a proposal \u2013 although there may be prominent community members or guilds, people with large token shares, or even active developers.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">All DAO features are typically available on Discord or a website. This commonly includes a list of tasks DAO members can do to aid or contribute to a DAO. Such actions are rewarded with\u00a0tokens.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>DAOs can typically set themselves up with a treasury of\u00a0<strong>locked<\/strong>\u00a0blockchain tokens people have sold to purchase the DAO\u2019s governance token.<\/p>\n<p>A good DAO example is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/makerdao.com\/en\/\">MakerDAO<\/a>, governing the use and control of the DAI\u00a0<strong>cryptocurrency<\/strong>. Holders of the governance token MKR give rights to vote on improvements to the DAI blockchain, modifying the output of smart contracts that help the DAI function, or even an emergency shutdown of the whole\u00a0<strong>protocol<\/strong>. The DAO has fractured into several decentralized core units performing services such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/immunefi.com\/bounty\/makerdao\/\">bug bounties<\/a>\u00a0and growth specialization, with their actions visible from the publicly accessible MakerDAO discord.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>dApp<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"dapp\"><\/a>Decentralized applications or dApps are applications that are secured on a\u00a0<b>blockchain<\/b>.

This means that the verification of transactions originally done by banks can now be secured by the built-in trust of a blockchain system.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>DeFi has huge growth potential should it gain mainstream adoption. For example, if all DeFi\u00a0<b>locked\u00a0<\/b>assets were to be\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/\">considered a bank<\/a>\u00a0right now, they would already be the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/382818\/leading-banks-in-europe-by-market-capitalization\/#:~:text=The%20highest%20market%20capitalization%20among,around%2085%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars.\">5th largest in Europe<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Ethereum<\/b><b><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"eth\"><\/a>Ethereum (ETH) is the second most popular<b>\u00a0blockchain\u00a0<\/b>with a current total market cap of \u20ac178B.

A gas fee is effectively payment for the electricity and validation work done to have a transaction recorded on the blockchain. This is because creating a\u00a0<b>block\u00a0<\/b>on a blockchain requires computational power and energy from the computers that have to validate each transaction. These are always paid by the user who wants to add transactions or programs to the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>Gas fees typically vary between blockchains depending on the number of transactions each block can hold, how fast it can validate a single transaction, and transaction demand.

A stablecoin\u2019s value pegged at \u20ac1 will always be \u20ac1 and backed by \u20ac1 in a bank account.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Crypto-backed \u2014 These are backed by an equivalent value in other cryptocurrencies or funds<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Algorithmically pegged \u2014 These maintain their value by altering supply and demand. For instance,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/vulcanpost.com\/791820\/terra-luna-timeline-how-crash-revival-plan\/\">the Luna token<\/a>\u00a0was kept more stable by being connected to the USDT token in the same Terra\u00a0<b>blockchain<\/b>\u00a0system. This example also demonstrates the dangers of relying on stablecoins as the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/vulcanpost.com\/791820\/terra-luna-timeline-how-crash-revival-plan\/\">Luna token infamously crashed<\/a>\u00a0under alleged market manipulation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Stablecoins have become a popular money transfer mechanism as it is almost always faster with lower transaction fees than through physical banks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Tokens<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"tokens\"><\/a>A token\u00a0is an electronic proof of asset ownership. These are typically split into two types. Fungible tokens like\u00a0<strong>Bitcoin\u00a0<\/strong>are identical, exchangeable tokens;\u00a0<b>non-fungible tokens (NFTs)<\/b>\u00a0are unique and cannot be reproduced.<\/p>\n<p>While not every\u00a0blockchain\u00a0has a token, most deploy a form of token to take advantage of their utility value. Uses for tokens include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cryptocurrencies<\/b>\u00a0are the most common form of tokens that can be exchanged for goods and services<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><i>Payment or utility tokens<\/i>\u00a0can be used to pay for services but only on the blockchain that produces the token. These could for instance be the in-game currency for a blockchain-based video game<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><i>Governance tokens\u00a0<\/i>can be seen as shares in a blockchain, giving you voting rights on major decisions regarding the future direction of that relevant blockchain<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">NFTs\u00a0that prove ownership over a unique digital asset such as art or a venue ticket.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Trilemma<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"tri\"><\/a>The Trilemma refers to the problem every\u00a0blockchain\u00a0has in having to compromise on either\u00a0<i>security, decentralization,\u00a0<\/i>or\u00a0<i>scalability<\/i>.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2017\/06\/09\/sales.html\">Coined by Vitalik Buterin<\/a>, one of the\u00a0<b>Ethereum<\/b>\u00a0co-founders, the trilemma points to each of the issues being interconnected:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Increasing decentralization makes the blockchain more computationally complex, slowing down transaction speed (scalability), and requires more work to keep the network secure<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Highly secure blockchains\u00a0cannot handle many transactions efficiently and so compromise on scalability<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Increasing transaction speed requires reducing the computational load in some way. This compromises decentralization and security.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All major blockchains are struggling to find a happy medium to this question. Most of them focus on emphasizing at least two of the three in accordance with what they want their blockchain to accomplish.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Wallet<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"wallet\"><\/a>A wallet stores your public and private\u00a0<b>keys<\/b>\u00a0so that you can access all your\u00a0<b>tokens.<\/b>\u00a0There are two main types of wallets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">fully digital \u201chot\u201d wallets such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/metamask.io\/\">Metamask<\/a>\u00a0that allow access from any device with just an internet connection.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">physical hardware \u201ccold\u201d wallets that store the keys offline. The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ledger.com\/\">Ledger<\/a>\u00a0USB drive for instance acts as a cold hardware wallet for your keys that you access only when plugging it in. Even a piece of paper with both keys written on them could be considered a cold wallet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Hot wallets are more convenient to use but more vulnerable than cold wallets due to being connected to the internet.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Web3<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a id=\"web3\"><\/a>Web3 or Web 3.0 is an umbrella term for projects deploying or using\u00a0<b>blockchain<\/b>\u00a0technology. These are the products that are considered to be suitable for the next web-volution.<\/p>\n<p>The term Web3 is a description for what many consider is the supposed next stage of the internet following Web1 and Web2.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/eshita.mirror.xyz\/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI\">The line of thinking is as follows<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Web1: also known as the \u2018read-only\u2019 form of the internet. The first version of the web in the 1990s was consuming static HTML pages that technical people built onto the web. Users could only look and read what other people posted on web pages. Projects were a collaborative effort, open-source, and unrestricted.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Web2: also known as the \u2018read and write\u2019 form is the current, modern form of the internet. Interactivity, interconnectivity, and content creation were introduced which allowed non-technical individuals to create and share content online. Users on social media can be creators and consumers simultaneously. This was facilitated by large corporations such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon Web Services. They now extract value from both the creators of internet content and the users who consume this content. Additionally, they mandate and control what can be created and posted on their platforms or communicated through their servers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Web3 is considered to be the \u2018read, write, and own\u2019 form of the internet. It aims to replace the larger centralized forces of Web2 such as Google and Facebook with\u00a0<b>DAO<\/b>s and decentralized governance. When users create, interact with, or contribute to content, they can claim ownership over that content as individuals instead of only with a corporation\u2019s permission. This ownership can now be technologically instead of legally or morally secured.\u00a0The dream is a bottom-up construction\u00a0of the internet and active participation from every contributor who wants to join the community.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Appendix: How to speak Web3<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Alpha<\/b>: valuable insider information<\/p>\n<p><b>Alt<\/b>: short for altcoin, any new, gimmicky, or not established coin in the ecosystem (e.g. Dogecoin)<\/p>\n<p><b>Ape<\/b>: someone bullish on Web3<\/p>\n<p><b>Buidl<\/b>: build<\/p>\n<p><b>DYOR<\/b>: do your own research<\/p>\n<p><b>FUD<\/b>: fear, uncertainty, doubt<\/p>\n<p><b>Fren<\/b>: friend<\/p>\n<p><b>Gm:\u00a0<\/b>good morning, a common greeting and used to promote positivity and a sense of community within the Web3 sphere<\/p>\n<p><b>GMI<\/b>: going to make it<\/p>\n<p><b>HFSP<\/b>: have fun staying poor<\/p>\n<p><b>Hodl<\/b>: hold.
