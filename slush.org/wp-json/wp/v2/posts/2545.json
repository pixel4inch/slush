There are going to be some heartfelt decisions that you\u2019re going to have to make that only you can make. You\u2019re going to agonize over them, you\u2019re going to have sleepless nights, and you\u2019re going to get conflicting feedback. You are going to be in very uncomfortable situations where you may have to fire your best mate, who was your co-founder. It may be that you are not the right person to take the company from a series B to a Series C. These are deeply emotional conversations.<\/p>\n<p>This is especially relevant for those who have been engineers in the past, who believe that they can make decisions based on data and facts and be unemotional about it. But the emotions do come in. You gave birth to this baby, that is your company. This thing that\u2019s been your life and soul, that has taken you away from your family, perhaps for the last four or five, six years. Is now the right time for you to hand the baton over? Having gone through some of those emotions myself, this is not something that\u2019s probably discussed as much as I\u2019d expect. And you can\u2019t hide away \u2013 the more you bury your head in the sand, the harder it is going to be to make the right decision.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Stephen Nundy, Lakestar Partner and CTO<\/b><\/h4>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#2: Getting Stuck is worse than failing&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]The most precious asset in life and startups is time and you should optimize for acceleration and faster learning more than moments in time.

The worst-case scenario is getting to a company that has $5 million in ARR and is growing 20% \u2013 it\u2019s too good to walk away from but it is not really what you signed up for. For me, that\u2019s always been the thing I\u2019ve been optimizing against. I would rather go big or go home.

It\u2019s good in general because it forces you to be creative, especially when we\u2019ve all got used to an abundance of everything. We all know that some of the best companies have been built in difficult times, and maybe that\u2019s the phase which we are entering. So less is more, no matter what. When there is too much noise, too much PR, too much money, it doesn\u2019t always go well.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Sonali De Ryker, Accel Partner<\/b><\/h4>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#4: The easiest problems are the ones people struggle the most with&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Hard problems are often easier than easy problems. This is something that people will find counterintuitive. If I say we are going to build the 6th release of the intercom messenger which is going to change how the internet communicates, you\u2019ll have a line of every principal designer and engineering PM wanting to be involved in that project. The best people will fight to get involved and make it the showcase of their career. Whereas, if I say that we need to get revision 2 of an integration out of the door, funnily enough, this door is not being beaten down.<\/p>\n<p>Oftentimes it is the latter that is important. It\u2019s hard to get quality work done on dull problems and it\u2019s easy to get quality work done on exciting problems. Those tasks that are damn dull are easy: when you have to break down exactly what you have to do, it\u2019s not that difficult technically. The implication of that is that you are more likely to screw things up on something ridiculously embarrassing in hindsight, than you are on something challenging and daunting. So think about the boring stuff that you are assuming will happen and will get done well in your organization, the basic blocking and tackling that you assume will be fine and easy. That will probably be the stuff that kills you.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/77Udb9ZPOjJ01N5ZRaQEDL?si=5ea06faf091f4ac3\"><strong>Des Traynor, Intercom Co-founder and CSO\u00a0<\/strong><\/a><\/h4>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#5: Let your problems sell themselves&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]This is relevant when trying to make a change that requires buy-in from your employees. Say you think we need middle-managers or something around onboarding or staggering. The temptation is to try and hold one big messy all-hands to explain your thinking and get everyone else to see the same problems that you see coming down the tracks. It never works. You get met with skepticism, albeit healthy skepticism of people saying \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it, but I don\u2019t see what you are talking about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The counterintuitive advice here is that you are better off letting these things just break. When something is clearly broken, everyone points to you and asks what\u2019s the solution here? And you say \u201cI guess we need a middle manager!\u201d If you need buy-in, people won\u2019t buy the solution unless they\u2019ve bought the problem. You can either go around selling the problem, or you can let the problem sell itself. Oftentimes, you let the problems sell themselves and people will beat your door down looking for a solution.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#6: Let the pendulum swing&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]This is originally from Shopify. Suppose that you could focus on two separate things: bugs or AI, feature A or feature B. Since both are important, the temptation is to try and split the middle, do a little bit of A and a little bit of B, move fast but not too fast. However, you end up giving a complex message to your company that can be hard to understand.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of \u201clet the pendulum swing\u201d is that you are oftentimes better off doing a huge amount of one then a huge amount of the other. This could be \u201cwe are going ship then work on quality then ship then work on quality.\u201d The effectiveness of a clear message that is simple, with no nuance to it, and universally understood with everyone on the same page is massive. The effectiveness of a nuanced message that requires interpretation by every individual can be washed out.<\/p>\n<p>In multiple cases, there is value to saying \u201cwe should do this thing and then we will do the next thing\u201d versus feeling the pressure to have a grand plan that covers all scenarios. I\u2019ve learned to love the borderline stupidity of just letting the pendulum swing and saying \u201cI know I said that that was important last quarter, but it\u2019s not important this quarter and that\u2019s ok.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#7: Senior executives can wait&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]It is usually better to wait to hire senior executives, what many people call \u201cdirector level\u201d people, until later in the business. I find that a lot of executives interview very well, but are terrible. A lot of hiring mistakes can be made at that middle management type of layer with people who are just, frankly, not up to your standard. I\u2019ve heard from a lot of VCs that say \u201chey, it\u2019s time for you to start hiring directors\u201d for a company that\u2019s 150 people. Do you need those directors? Is that what you need right now? Do you need it everywhere? Or do you just need it in some places?<\/p>\n<p>This also applies if you have met someone who you think is great and could be a fantastic leader for an organization, but you already have a good person with who you feel very comfortable within the role.\u00a0Then you need to start going out there and really understanding what great looks like to be sure.\u00a0For example, if you\u2019re looking for a great marketing leader, reach out to people that you know and respect and say \u201cdo you know any fantastic CMOs, I don\u2019t want to hire them, I just want to talk to them for 30 to 45 minutes, and better understand their role.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Figure out what are the companies that are most like you, who are some truly great CMOs out there that you could potentially talk to, and use that to create a rubric for what you might want to look for in this particular hire.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/5h9RFLcaEPlKKDdB6SRHz7?si=861ebc509bf2445a\"><b>Cristina Cordova, First Round Partner<\/b><\/a><\/h4>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#8: Execution sets you apart&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]It\u2019s ok to make mistakes early on: you\u2019re going to make a lot of them.

But it\u2019s not the whole truth. It\u2019s certainly not how I have spent my time.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that I feel that I haven\u2019t worked a ton, but there\u00a0have been times when I\u2019ve been at the office\u00a0executing meetings for way below those expected hours. What has been the toughest part has been the mental load. It has been the thinking time and the dinner discussions with my wife around people dynamics and stuff like that. I\u2019m not going to hide it, at the end of the day it is tough to be a founder. But that 80-hour work week, it doesn\u2019t have to be like that.
