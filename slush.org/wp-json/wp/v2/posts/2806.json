It has changed the way we must manufacture, transport, warehouse, and distribute products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>Navigating these shifts can be daunting for both the new digital companies and the existing industrial players. With La Famiglia, Jeannette wanted to explore how to connect the new generation of founders with their industrial counterparts at the very start of their entrepreneurial journey. A key ingredient is fostering a mutually beneficial environment where information, tacit knowledge, and innovative ideas flow freely.

However, Jeannette mentions that European industry is well-positioned to solve this challenge, as it has had to build freight solutions in a fragmented market for decades.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn Europe, we understand the intricacies related to the relationships and complexities of volume due to the decentralized inner markets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>With access to the breadth of knowledge, Forto set out to digitize and at least semi-automate the majority of the complex multi-step operation.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs the underlying infrastructure begins to transform and digitize, Forto has built a modular product across sea, air, and rail freight that allows customers to book shipments with full transparency quickly. Forto improves customers visibility so they can track goods more efficiently throughout the supply chain, resulting in better profit margins.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>Bridging the industry gap:<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><i>Further digitizing the freight forward industry, one of the biggest industries in the world valued at close to $1 trillion, the access to established industry players has been extremely valuable for both parties.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the case of Forto, we were able to connect the team directly with established industry CEOs who wrestle with supply chain visibility issues every day. We started by moving just a fraction of the old industries freight volume to Forto and together observed how that significantly improved existing visibility challenges.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This rare access between the new economy and established industry meant that instead of having to focus on the acquisition of first customers, Forto could immediately start iterating on the product through feedback, and steadily increase volume from the get-go. La Famiglia\u2019s introductions accounted for 10% of Forto\u2019s revenue in 2019 which fueled their break into larger client segments.<\/i>[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Entrepreneurship as a creative process&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>In Jeannette\u2019s mind, creativity and entrepreneurship have always gone\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/seedcamp.com\/podcasts\/la-famiglias-jeannette-zu-furstenberg-and-judith-dada-on-the-picasso-painting-that-is-a-startup\/\"><i>hand in hand<\/i><\/a><i>\u00a0in their ability to push boundaries, epitomized in her own grandfather.\u00a0\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>\u201c<\/b>My grandfather, who was an innovative and disruptive entrepreneur, was actually originally an artist.

Abstracting away the complexity. It\u2019s crucial to understand what excites the founder about the problem and motivates them to solve it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>How unique is the person in articulating the problem?

It\u2019s not just about these but also the creative ability to craft a vision of the future.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about the best founders we meet, is that they have almost a reality distortion field in the way that they think about the future. They\u2019re able to anticipate and draw a very different, but still distinct image of the future, that answers to whether the market they are describing exists or will it exist, and what the indicators to why it could exist are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>A strong founder vision helps to execute and convey the story to others when looking 10 to 15 years into the future.<\/i>\u00a0<i>Clich\u00e9 yet true, founders need to really care about the problem and be very motivated to get it solved.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most exciting conversations we have are with the founders who have worked in technology and established industry companies.
