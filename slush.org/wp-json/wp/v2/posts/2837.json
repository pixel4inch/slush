In a typical fund, the general partners (GPs) run the fund and make the ultimate call on whether to invest in your company or not, and the lion\u2019s share of fund capital comes from limited partners (LPs). LPs are entities that manage large amounts of capital; for example insurance companies, banks, pension funds, pooled investment funds (funds-of-funds), family offices, government and academic institutions, and high-net-worth individuals.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>LPs invest in venture capital for many reasons, for instance the potential for high returns, supporting\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/entrepreneurship-redefined\/revolutionary-innovation\/\">revolutionary innovation<\/a>, and asset diversification. Compared to other asset classes, venture capital is particularly non-liquid and risky \u2013 therefore the upside needs to be\u00a0<em>significant<\/em>\u00a0to incentivize investment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>General partners try to convince limited partners that their fund will return above-market returns with their investment thesis (their playbook for choosing investments) and their access to deals that match the thesis. As a founder, your company should match the VC\u2019s investment thesis \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t fit their focus area, the odds of investment are significantly lower. On the other hand, as a startup you want a VC who has experience in your sector, even more so when it comes to more complex deeptech solutions.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;How VCs make money: Fund math&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Typically a VC fund\u2019s lifetime is 10 years, split into:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Initial investment period (2-3 years) \u2013 this is when the fund is actively looking for and making new investments.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Portfolio development period (3-5 years) \u2013 this is when the fund is focused on portfolio development and follow-on investments.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Exit period (2-3 years) \u2013\u00a0this is when the fund will pursue to exit ownership stakes in their portfolio companies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VC firms can and often do have multiple funds at the same time, so they often raise money every 3-5 years for a new fund (if they can).<\/p>\n<p>Intuitively it might seem like a great win if a VC fund invests a million and later sells their stake for say, twenty million. After all, they\u2019ve returned their initial investment twenty times over. But that\u2019s not the case: the VC model doesn\u2019t work by making a little bit of money on a lot of deals, but instead by a few select deals bringing in extreme outlier returns.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a \u20ac50M fund to explain why that\u2019s the case. Typically a fund of this size will have:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>\u20ac20M for initial investments.\u00a0<\/b>For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that the fund will invest in 20 different companies over a 2-3 year period with an average ticket size of \u20ac1M per company for 10% of ownership.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>\u20ac20M for potential follow-on investments.\u00a0<\/b>As portfolio companies go through subsequent funding rounds, they will issue more stock to raise more equity. Consequently, the fund\u2019s share in the company will be diluted, and they\u2019ll need to do follow-on investments to defend their ownership share. In practice, VCs tend to double down on the most promising companies instead of spreading their follow-on money evenly across their portfolio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>\u20ac10M for management fees.<\/b>\u00a0VC funds typically operate under a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/t\/two_and_twenty.asp\">2 and 20<\/a>\u201d fee arrangement. \u201c2\u201d refers to a yearly 2% management fee that the VC fund charges their LPs for managing their money \u2013\u00a0this roughly amounts to \u20ac10M during the lifetime of the fund. The management fee is used to cover the expenses of the fund, for example salaries, an office, travel etc. \u201c20\u201d refers to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.holloway.com\/g\/venture-capital\/sections\/carried-interest-and-management-fees\">carried interest<\/a>\u00a0(or \u2018carry\u2019) \u2013 a 20% cut of money VCs get beyond returning the initial investment to their investors. It is the carry in particular that makes VC so lucrative for the individuals running the fund. For the purposes of this fund math illustration, we\u2019re not calculating the amount of carried interest here.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These investments turn into returns through\u00a0<i>successful liquidity events<\/i>, i.e. when a startup exits through an acquisition or goes public, whether that be through an IPO,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/doing-things-the-spotify-way-the-road-to-direct-listing\/\">a direct listing<\/a>, or a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/ipo-spac-or-direct-listing-picking-a-path-to-the-public-market\/\">SPAC<\/a>. Yet, building a successful startup is extremely difficult \u2013 most never reach an exit. Out of the 20 example companies above, half will go bankrupt and eight will only give modest returns. That leaves two companies to return the fund and make a profit. These two outliers have to be the so-called \u2018fund returners\u2019. For example, to make 3x returns, which some would consider moderate over a decade, the fund returners would have to exit with \u20ac1.5 billion so that the fund would return \u20ac150M for its 10% stakes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What governs this process is the\u00a0<i>power law<\/i>, meaning that the distribution of returns in venture capital is heavily skewed \u2013 a very small percentage of startups bring a large percentage of the returns. Fund returners make up for the losses of the other investments in the portfolio. A good example of power law in action is Sequoia\u2019s investment in Whatsapp, which was acquired for $22B by Facebook in 2014. For a Series A investment of $60M, Sequoia Capital got a $3B return. Although, this 50x return pales in comparison with Y Combinator\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/startups\/y-combinator-biggest-startups-gone-public-airbnb-doordash\/#:~:text=Just%2024%20hours%20before%20Airbnb,billion%20for%20a%20YC%20company.\">estimated<\/a>\u00a0112,500x return on their $20,000 investment in AirBnb \u2013 exited for $2.25B.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is why the startup ecosystem is obsessed with companies valued upwards from \u20ac1B, i.e. unicorns \u2013 VCs need them to survive.

Investors look for people who are somewhat delusional with their company vision, but have the skills and conviction to make that vision a reality against overwhelming odds \u2013 a perfect mixture of \u201csmart enough to succeed, dumb enough to try\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This general mindset of ambition and resolve has been well encapsulated in the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paulgraham.com\/founders.html\">five traits<\/a>\u00a0to look for in a founder, outlined by Y Combinator\u2019s Paul Graham. There are of course many other\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/entrepreneurshandbook.co\/13-traits-that-really-matter-in-a-startups-founding-team-454fe4d4535e\">traits<\/a>\u00a0that VCs look for in founders such as knowledge, EQ and IQ, integrity, adaptability, curiosity, and leadership etc. In fact, different VCs even have their own frameworks for doing\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/founder-due-diligence-vc\/\">\u2018founder due diligence\u2019<\/a>, so the exact concoction of these may be VC-dependent.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#2: Team\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>There\u2019s an often romanticized concept of startup founders having a lightbulb moment and coming up with a billion dollar idea (ehm, Social Network) and then making it big. In reality, founders often have to pivot from their original idea multiple times before finding product\/market fit. In the startup canon it is furthermore often emphasized that it isn\u2019t the ideas themselves but their execution that ultimately matters \u2013 and this hinges on the early team\u2019s ability to work together to realize their vision.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Likewise to founder traits there\u2019s a slew of desirable team attributes to choose from. Often-cited characteristics of successful teams are things like: complementary strengths and weaknesses, having a generally diverse team, and joint commitment to the company vision.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Past experience:\u00a0<\/i><\/b>VCs will also often look at your early team\u2019s past experiences. This means not only work experience that would give the founders readiness to tackle their chosen problem, but also achievements that showcase outstanding abilities or a \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ycombinator.com\/howtoapply\/\">hacker mentality<\/a>\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Founder-market fit.\u00a0<\/i><\/b>While there\u2019s a lot of talk about product-market fit, in the early stages it is particularly\u00a0<i>founder<\/i>-market fit (FMF) that can make the difference. FMF refers to the founders having a deep understanding of their chosen market, and a high level of personal motivation bordering on obsession to solve their chosen problem in that market. Since ideas aren\u2019t proprietary, investors have to think if there could be someone better to execute this same idea.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#3: Cap table\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A cap table describes the ownership structure of the company \u2013 who owns how much of which class of shares. Investors generally want to see a \u2018clean\u2019 cap table. This means having a reasonable amount of shareholders in the company, and therefore a less complicated ownership structure. As a consequence, everyone on board is a clear value add, meaning no disproportionately big shares for advisors or angel investors, and no dragging along founders who\u2019ve left the venture.\u00a0A clean cap table also makes communication and voting easier.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All in all, founders should use discretion when choosing who to put on the cap table. Being on the cap table means that this person has decision-making power. If an investor proves to be a suboptimal fit it can result in a lot of problems throughout the company journey.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another important feature investors look for in a cap table is that operational founders have a large enough share of ownership so that they\u2019re properly incentivized to build the company in the long run. It\u2019s important that while having to scrape through the tough phases of an early-stage venture\u00a0founders are motivated to stay on board for the ride which can last up to ten years or more. In practice, this usually translates to founders owning at least 50% of total equity by the time the company scales.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Product&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<h4><strong>#1: Rough idea or problem space<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While an idea won\u2019t make it far without a strong team executing it, it\u2019s really difficult to build a unicorn with a bad idea. In order for a startup idea to be successful and have \u2018disruptive potential,\u2019 it is often said that the founders should either have experienced the problem themselves or have a close connection to the problem otherwise. This way the founders will be very passionate about solving it and have the grit to endure the ebbs and flows that come with being a founder. Depending on the idea, you may need to have some domain expertise.<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.paulgraham.com\/organic.html\">organic pull<\/a>\u00a0of a problem is very attractive to VCs, and a personal backstory makes for a neat narrative also in the direction of customers. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t get VC funding with another kind of problem, but you might need to demonstrate a higher level of industry knowledge and be more convincing on why the problem is important \u2013 as well as why you\u00a0<i>specifically\u00a0<\/i>are the team to solve the problem.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You might also want to have some\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/product-glossary-soaked-by-slush\/#poc\">proof of concept<\/a>\u00a0to demonstrate that your idea is worth investing in. This means that you in some way illustrate that the idea is something that can actually be built; whether that be through developing a sample or testing it on the market. However, this doesn\u2019t mean showing that there\u2019s a market demand for your idea, which is where traction comes in.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#2: Early customer traction\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even at the very earliest stage, showcasing initial customer traction in conjunction with your proof of concept is a big plus. Its purpose is to demonstrate some level of validation for the idea and that you are building something that people actually need.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Traction can often be measured in revenue, daily active users, or something else depending on the sector: for example for a deeptech startup this could mean having intellectual property, since a deeptech startup likely won\u2019t have any users at the seed stage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Since traction is essentially about validation, it can also be measured through things like focus groups, industry research, and creating a waiting list,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jameschurch.medium.com\/how-much-traction-do-you-need-to-win-over-investors-in-a-seed-round-be37280b8c67\">among other things<\/a>.

For example, for B2C companies, the focus is on engagement and retention rather than recurring revenue. For B2B companies, investors only tend to care about month-on-month (MoM) growth once you\u2019ve achieved 1M ARR, but if they do care, the desired range tends to fall between\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lennysnewsletter.com\/p\/what-is-a-good-growth-rate?r=1gicv2&amp;s=r&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\">15 to 25%<\/a>. In general, success can be showcased in a more liberal selection of ways such as the number of waitlisted users or signups, unusually low customer acquisition cost (CAC), low churn, and other factors that play into growth in the longer run.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Market&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<h4><strong>Total Addressable Market (TAM)<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To turn grand visions into reality, there are certain physical limitations. One of the most significant ones is the size of the total addressable market (TAM), which refers to the maximum size of your opportunity. For example, Facebook\u2019s TAM is essentially anyone who has access to the internet, whereas a dog walking application\u2019s TAM is people who own and don\u2019t want to walk their dogs \u2013 significantly smaller.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>TAM is the proxy for the size of the opportunity for VCs. Crudely put, the bigger your TAM, the bigger the potential revenue of your company. VCs need to see that you\u2019re targeting a large enough market and have a realistic roadmap to seizing a significant share of said market to make their investment worthwhile. TAM assessments are particularly emphasized in the early stages, where company financials are nascent or non-existent.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For example, Revolut\u2019s original estimated market size was at $3B \u2013 and this was only for its initial market, the UK. Similarly, Intercom\u2019s original market estimate was $21B. Both companies\u2019 early pitch decks alongside others can be found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbinsights.com\/research\/billion-dollar-startup-pitch-decks\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Companies with smaller TAMs than Facebook can of course become unicorns, and some of the best companies have started off in markets that don\u2019t seem to show significant promise at first but grow incredibly fast. After all, Facebook itself was initially only intended for Harvard students connecting with one another. Yet even these surprising winners at some point still have to persuade VCs to bet on them \u2013 if the market isn\u2019t showing promise yet, founders need to have a convincing story for why it eventually will.<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, compared to other attributes VCs look at in the early stage, TAM is a lot more binary \u2013 you either have it or you don\u2019t, even if the justifications for TAM assessments are debatable.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.productplan.com\/glossary\/total-addressable-market\/\">Here\u2019s more info on TAM and how you can calculate it.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Make sure to also take a look at how these attributes may be reflected on your pre-seed pitch deck\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/how-to-ace-your-pre-seed-pitch-deck\/\"><i>here<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VCs\u2019 expectations vary from stage to stage, and the above ones primarily pertain to very early stage startups raising their first pre-seed, and seed rounds. The difference between pre-seed and seed is that pre-seed funding is used to demonstrate a\u00a0<i>market need<\/i>, whereas seed funding is used to prove a\u00a0<i>market fit<\/i>. This is why Series A is often referred to as the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/how-to-raise-a-series-a-a-story-by-creandum-and-seon\/\">P\/M fit round<\/a>, as it is the first significant round of financing after P\/M fit. These are the earliest, and often the smallest, rounds a company will raise. The size of a seed round will be determined by how much money the startup needs to reach its next milestone \u2013 which in turn varies between products, geography, and how competitive the market is among other things.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, founders should also be mindful of the implications of accepting VC funding: once you\u2019ve shared equity you\u2019re no longer the only person you\u2019re building for. You\u2019ve entered a contract to build a company that needs to exit as a unicorn within the decade or sooner. This means that your exclusive focus should be on growth to justify a potential exit.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Who doesn\u2019t fit the VC mold?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]There are clearly many companies that don\u2019t fit the bill. The VC model works most optimally for startups with specific traits, namely those that are massively scalable and capital efficient, can go through rapid iteration cycles, and have recurring revenues and low marginal costs \u2013 which often best describes software startups.<\/p>\n<p>The types of startups that are less likely to attract VC funding by these metrics are deeptech, service businesses, and hardware companies<b>.<\/b>\u00a0While they may have scalable businesses, their timeline for scaling isn\u2019t necessarily one that aligns with the VC cycle, their TAM may be too niche\/small, or they rely heavily on labor in scaling. Where these lag, even a brilliant team and idea aren\u2019t necessarily enough to tip the scales in favor of VCs funding your company.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another category of companies that aren\u2019t necessarily VC fundable are those that formally meet the characteristics of a startup but don\u2019t aim for high enough or fast enough growth. For example, a SaaS business valued at \u20ac50M may offer massive financial returns for the founders, but a negligent one for VCs looking for \u20ac1B fund returners.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, there are also companies in these categories that have been VC funded, such as deeptech startups like SpaceX, Lilium, Darktrace, and DeepMind, and hardware ones like Nothing, Nest, and Beats.\u00a0And of course it\u2019s good to note that tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Intel were also deeptech startups in their origins and\/or had a hardware component like Apple. So while getting to the top may be riskier, take a longer return on investment for VCs, and require more capital, the upside is also potentially enormous.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Many VC funds may indeed be industry agnostic \u2013 but due to the system overall they are less likely to invest in, for example, deeptech that can often take longer to commercialize than a software application. Even so, within the VC system there are certain funds that focus specifically on funding research-based innovations and hardware\u00a0such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/27\/fifty-years-a-deep-tech-investor-has-raised-90-million-from-tens-of-unicorn-founders\/\">Fifty Years<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/luxcapital.com\/\">Lux Capital<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/decarb-decade-is-the-obvious-ventures-path-by-andrew-beebe\/\">Obvious Ventures<\/a>.

This tells us if the technology can work, when it will likely be working by, what problems it can be used to solve, and how big the market is for solving those problems.\u201d<\/div>\n<h5>Growth and progress expectations<\/h5>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">\u201cDeeptech companies typically do not have smooth growth trajectories like with traditional enterprise SaaS. The timelines are often determined more by the technology readiness level and the nature of the the product than they are by simply being a novel deep technology. For example, timelines for a new hardware sensor may be longer than a new ML algorithm due to supply chain, tooling, and shipping limitations. What is important is that the company is able to demonstrate significant reductions in risk, both technical and commercial, in sufficient increments that they will be able to advocate for more funding to continue making progress.\u201d<\/div>\n<h5>Assessing the scale of the opportunity<\/h5>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">\u201cTo evaluate the scale of the market opportunity, we look for where the novel deep technology intersects different markets. CRISPR for example can be used for therapeutics, fuels, materials, etc. We then look at the size of those markets and their rate of growth and determine what the TAM would be for this new technology. Obviously, any startup should be hyper-focused on one initial use case where they can be 10x better, but we also want to know that the company can scale broadly and capture significant value that is commensurate with the risk and capital requirements to develop the new deep technology. We consider the initial use case a wedge into what should be a very broad and large market.\u201d<\/div>\n<h5>Red flags<\/h5>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\">\u201cTiming and compound risk are typically the two biggest concerns with deeptech investments. For many deep technologies the question is when and not if. If there isn\u2019t a strong rationale as to why the timing to $100M+ revenue is within venture time horizons (5-10 years) then that is a red flag. Similarly, if the market isn\u2019t large and obvious for a new technology, you have the compound risk of: #1 the technology working and #2 there being PMF when the technology works. Typically we want to see a very large, obvious, broad market for a new deep technology to be applied into (vis-a-vis a product) when it is ready. Venture capital is not designed to fund open ended research. Government grants are better for that. Venture capital is designed to fund risky business endeavors where the reward is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the risk. It is hard to close that math when there is significant compound risk.\u201d<\/div>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Funding for alternative ventures&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Companies that aren\u2019t VC fundable do have other forms of funding \u2013 in fact, most startups aren\u2019t even VC funded. For example these funding sources are available:<\/p>\n<p><b><br \/>\nAngel investors\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Angel investors are individual investors that can provide early-stage capital to startups. Angel investors range from hobbyists investing small tickets to professionals participating in large VC rounds. The difference to VC funds is that angels are investing their own money \u2013 and are thus responsible to themselves. An angel investor might be happy with a smaller return on an investment as they\u2019ll get 100% of the money returned.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Bootstrapping\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapping means financing the company through other means than outside investments. Often this means that the founders have other sources of income, financing through debt, sweat equity, or financing through company revenues. Some famous bootstrapped companies include MailChimp and Spanx, and for example\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/9-bootstrapping-lessons-for-early-stage-founders\/\">Infobip<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/6-lessons-for-founders-from-a-european-decacorn\/\">Celonis<\/a>\u00a0in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>CVCs<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Corporate Venture Capital or corporate venturing refers to the venture arms of big corporations, such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gv.com\/\">Google Ventures<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.intelcapital.com\/\">Intel Capital<\/a>.\u00a0The investments can either be done through a minor stake similar to a regular VC, or through a venture client model where the startup and corporation in question work on joint projects funded by the CVC.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Family offices\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Family offices help wealthy families invest their money to protect their family wealth. Alongside VC and angel capital, family offices are one of the three most common funding sources in the early stages.

These usually take place at the same stages as angel rounds, but are on average smaller than the latter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Government grants and subsidies<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Many governments have subsidy and grant programs to support startup founders, most often in the early stages of building.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Revenue-based financing<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Somewhat of a hybrid between equity financing and debt financing, revenue-based financing works through the startup in question paying off a loan they take from an investor with generated revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Venture debt<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Venture debt is loan financing designed to provide funding between equity rounds.
