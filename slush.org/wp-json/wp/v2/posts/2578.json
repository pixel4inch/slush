No, it\u2019s not the end of the world, but this should happen sooner rather than later in the lifetime of a company. If you are still early-stage, the pain and complexity of exchanging your brand is much smaller than when you are already present in a variety of markets and have spent time and money on building your brand in them.<\/p>\n<p>With that, we strongly recommend you check any brand protection infringements on Day One. First off, ask a brand lawyer to check your name and register it on at least a continental level if not on a global level directly. If there are too many conflicts, go back to the drawing board. Remember, it only gets harder later.<\/p>\n<p><i>Quick anecdote here:<\/i>\u00a0At Zalando, we felt such pressure in our second year as someone filed a similar brand name in our trade group of apparel. This put us under massive pressure to find a solution as we otherwise would have had to change our name after having already spent millions of dollars in advertising with it. Luckily, we came to an agreement with the other party and could continue to use our brand. But, make no mistake, this caused a bunch of sleepless nights.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;2.

Repeatedly ask yourselves this when you define your brand.<\/p>\n<p>At Spotify, we wanted to be the product that enabled people to listen to all the world\u2019s music for free at your fingertips. What was our reason for being? Why was this even important? We believed that listening to music would lead you to a richer life and experience more emotions since that\u2019s what music does. It makes us feel intensely and live more deeply. We also wanted to empower the world to enjoy more music.<\/p>\n<p>What was the spark that led Daniel and Martin to start Spotify? It was the fact that, at the time in 2006, there was no other way to enjoy music legally online and just click play to listen. No one else had cracked the problem of listening to music online while serving a great user experience. These were the problems we wanted to solve.<\/p>\n<p>So, think seriously about what\u2019s your reason for being as a brand, what\u2019s the insight that took you there, what\u2019s the problem you\u2019re solving, what\u2019s the solution to that problem, and who you want to present yourself as.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;3.

Some marketing team members liked one attribute more than the others and we quickly had a\u00a0<i>very<\/i>\u00a0creative set around 10 different USPs.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, we saw that customers could not remember our core USPs and they got diluted by missing consistency. Therefore, we defined our three core USPs and from that day onwards they were put on every single marketing product and ad exactly in the same wording, order, and so forth. This type of consistency made everything more streamlined, and ultimately strengthened our value proposition to the consumer.<\/p>\n<p>We encourage you to define your three USPs early on, implement them without any compromise, and repeat them everywhere all the time (Sophia gets to that later). And, yes, just three. No customer can remember any more than that.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;4.

This was something we did at Spotify after having seen how well it worked for Gmail and their invite-only strategy.<\/p>\n<p>We also did it to be able to scale the technology in a controlled, high-quality way and to see how our users would interact with the product. We knew we had built something we ourselves loved to use, but how about the people on the street?<\/p>\n<p>We rolled out a closed beta test and immediately received some quite stunning reviews. \u201cBest thing on the internet\u201d and \u201cbest innovation since sliced bread\u201d were some of the comments from our community of beta testers. This testing also boosted a strong relationship with our early adopters. We valued their input and feedback and they felt like a part of the Spotify journey. This type of back-and-forth builds a relationship of trust and loyalty \u2014 on both sides! This, in turn, builds a strong foundation to build a brand on.<\/p>\n<p>After all this, we then made sure to capture the demand and encourage people to sign up for our waiting list.

Every dollar counts \u2014 bulletproof your marketing analytics&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<b>Christian<\/b><strong>:<\/strong>\u00a0We had a very strict rule at Zalando: Every marketing dollar we spent needed to be tracked.<\/p>\n<p>We needed to know exactly what the return of that dollar was and whether we would do this again. This all was very aligned with one of our company values of \u201cwhat you can\u2019t measure isn\u2019t there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To make sure we could track our whole spending, we built a marketing analytics department early on. In our case, this was led by a mathematics PhD who loved numbers (certainly not a bad prerequisite for this role). His team ensured that we had a functioning and up-to-date marketing report every day. These days, most of this can be done via different analytics tools (Google Analytics, etc), although these usually don\u2019t cover all channels of operation. For example, all offline channels are usually excluded here and a CRM is not always fully integrated. So, you need someone who helps you to get the complete landscape overview of your marketing spend, efficiencies, and revenue resulting in your main steering KPIs, CAC, and CLV.<\/p>\n<p>We also had a rule that we were okay to pre-finance a customer for 180 days, meaning that a customer needed to break even after six months (CAC = CLV). Whether you take 180 days or 360 days or only \u201cfirst transaction profitable\u201d depends on your business model. The longer the customer lifetime, the longer you can pre-finance a customer. Another important factor is your funding and if you can afford to \u201cwait\u201d 180 days or 360 days until you earn your customer acquisition costs back.<\/p>\n<p>The main lesson here is that you need to establish the mantra in your marketing or growth team, and that you always have to be aware of this equation and require absolute clarity on all marketing spends per channel. A bulletproof marketing analytics team is crucial to give you the database to make the right decisions (and to determine in which channel do you get more bang for your buck and where do you shift more budget to).[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;6.

We are fully convinced that every successful company needs its own individual marketing flywheel.<\/p>\n<p>A clear proofpoint is that all major consumer companies andmost B2B companies have a very clear flywheel which spurs their growth. It won\u2019t be possible to build a large company without having identified and finetuned such a flywheel in many day-and-night sessions gathering all your data and insights.<\/p>\n<p>But what the hell is the marketing flywheel? The flywheel gives an overview of all relevant customer acquisition and retention channels that a company uses successfully to grow its customer base (new customer acquisition) and to nurture its existing customer base leading it to further engagement and ultimately monetization and revenues\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/emojipedia.org\/money-with-wings\/\">\ud83d\udcb8<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Since all companies are different, they all have different marketing flywheels as well. For some growth via social media is super important, for others, the key driver may be different like growth through above-the-line marketing, etc. Take the time to define, optimize, and fuel one that suits your company.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;10.

At Spotify, I always wanted us to be personal, honest, generous, and fun in our communications. If you think about the characteristics that set a friend apart from the crowd and why you feel great when spending time together, it\u2019s about sharing \u2014 and daring \u2014 to be personal and, at the same time, generous and fun.<\/p>\n<p>The way we greeted someone calling the reception, behaved at our offices, how we expressed ourselves in our external and internal communications, how we built the product, how we trained the customer support team, how we created our offline expression at festivals and events always had the same sort of Spotify vibe and tone of voice. I wanted it to be easy to get a sense of what the Spotify DNA was.<\/p>\n<p>It helped that we were young, ambitious, and from a small country up north, taking on the whole music industry in a playful and fun way while always putting our users front-and-center; and obsessing about building an outstanding product that was taking both fans and creators into account.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221;
