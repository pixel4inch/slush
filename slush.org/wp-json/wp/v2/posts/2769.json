By that I mean that the company has existed since 2006, but the initial idea dates back to 2001. This means we have actually had five years of learning, experimenting, and testing things before Infobip even started as a company.<\/p>\n<p>During that time we worked on different projects, tried out dozens of different options until we found the right product, the right fit. Everything we did was around communications, but it took five years to get that perfect fit. So naturally, when the company was founded we were profitable from the get-go.<\/p>\n<p>I understand now how this pre-company phase helped us on our bootstrapping journey since we\u2019ve had a product-market fit before we had the company. Had it been the other way around, I don\u2019t know if we would\u2019ve managed to bootstrap our way as we did.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I would say that bootstrapping is for those early-stage companies that either:<\/p>\n<p>1) do not require large influxes of capital, particularly from outside sources, or<\/p>\n<p>2) those that already have a product-market fit, and are profitable from the start like we were.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#2 Make a clear-cut commitment&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>Izabel:<\/strong>\u00a0What I think is really important to succeed is to be all in. When I first started back in 2003 I was working part-time, and there were more than a couple of occasions where I would come really close to quitting or even quit. I now know it\u2019s easy to think that way if you\u2019re not all in and if you\u2019re working part-time.<\/p>\n<p>Once you dedicate yourself completely, these thoughts disappear. Instead of looking for a way out, you\u2019re looking for a way to solve an issue. Your attention and time are not divided. So yes, everyone needs to be all in to make it work.<\/p>\n<p>It sounds like a lot, but without dedication, sound work ethics, and pure single-mindedness, the chances of success that are slim to begin with, become non-existent. That is the cost of being self-made aka bootstrapped.<\/p>\n<p><i>How about the money side of things?

To be honest I didn\u2019t even know those options existed, let alone how to secure them.<\/p>\n<p>But this was a\u00a0<i>long<\/i>\u00a0time ago. When we started The Internet was barely accessible. I remember the time we got a space in an incubator in the city of Pula, Croatia in 2006, which was a big deal. We got the space and we weren\u2019t going there for the first couple of months so the agency director called us and said \u2018\u2019Why aren\u2019t you coming? We\u2019ll give the space to someone else.\u2019\u2019 And we told him \u2018\u2019Look there\u2019s no Internet, we can\u2019t work there.\u2019\u2019 to which he replied \u2018\u2019What do you need the Internet for? Why aren\u2019t you working on something normal?\u2019\u2019<\/p>\n<p>So you can say the temptation of an investment wasn\u2019t as strong as it is nowadays. I feel it\u2019s more common now for startups to get, for example, a third round of investment and to check it off the list as some kind of milestone. That was never our way of operating.<\/p>\n<p>We were focused on advancing on our own merits, never thinking that we have to get an investment, that it\u2019s a must. That way if you create something that flops, you\u2019re turbo concentrated to fix it. Since there\u2019s no safety net in terms of money (except the one you earn), you get to act fast to resolve the matter, to get the market fit, to get the paying customer. If you don\u2019t make the right product, you don\u2019t get the money so you stay extra focused all the time. And you adopt a problem-solving attitude very early on.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#4 Define what an investment means for you&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>Silvio:\u00a0<\/strong>It\u2019s pretty clear that we weren\u2019t looking for investments, we were looking for a product that will succeed on the market. And in my opinion, that\u2019s the better way to do things. It\u2019s a slower way, for sure, but if you have the luxury of getting to a certain level all by yourself, it\u2019s the best feeling.<\/p>\n<p>For us, an investment was never a goal but a means to an end we would take at the right time for the right cause. And that\u2019s often where young founders make a mistake: they opt for an investment before they really need it.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how we\u2019ve played that game:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Beginning stage: in those pre-Infobip days (early 2000s), I took a small loan from my parents as starting capital. This money gave us time to explore and experiment until we got a product-market fit, and was paid back in full.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Customer-funded stage: we funded our company when we had a product-market fit (2006) and were profitable from day one. All the money was reinvested in company development and growth. It took more time, but it ensured stable growth and gave us freedom and independence to make our own choices. This stage lasted for almost 15 years.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Credit stage: we raised our Series A investment round in 2020. We\u2019ve raised \u20ac300 million from One Equity Partners for M&amp;A and entering the American market, which is hard to penetrate without a lot of resources.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Next credit stage: we raised an additional $500 million through direct loan placement from Credit Group of Ares Management Corporation and BlackRock for even stronger growth and new M&amp;A activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our bootstrapping was based on, besides the loan from my parents, selling and keeping operating costs as low as possible. However, there are other methods worth exploring like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/corporatefinanceinstitute.com\/resources\/knowledge\/valuation\/sweat-equity\/\">sweat equity<\/a>, inventory minimization, subsidy finance etc.<\/p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean we weren\u2019t talking with investors before 2020. There were some serious investors that wanted to be a part of this, but we were doing our best to keep an eye on our cash flow and loved the idea of having complete freedom to decide what and how it will be done. Besides, raising money is quite time consuming for management and we were a very small company so we had to focus our time on our customers and our product.<\/p>\n<p>One investor actually even came to Vodnjan all the way from New York, went to our town\u2019s festivities, and even played beach volleyball with us just to get a chance to talk to us. It didn\u2019t work in the end, but we appreciated the effort and we preferred having him enjoy a few days with us than flying out immediately.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#5 Stay hungry, stay flexible&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>Not having investor money comes with certain limitations, but also a different set of incentives and possibilities that could work to the founders\u2019 advantage.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p><strong>Izabel:<\/strong>\u00a0One of the cons of bootstrapping that people often refer to, is that it limits your growth potential. That\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary to stay hungry and to keep pushing, to look forward to the challenges.<\/p>\n<p>The great thing there is that you\u2019re free to take a chance, to change course, to shape-shift your product to feed the market need. We\u2019ve adapted time and time again and because of that fluidity, we were able to follow the industry trends and market needs.<\/p>\n<p>It seems to me that today when startups get an investment, they get comfortable. They know they\u2019re covered for the next X number of months so they tend to prolong development and sound business results. While when you\u2019re bootstrapped it needs to happen\u00a0<b>now<\/b>. It\u2019s a different mindset: you\u2019re forced to constantly think of everything and be on top of things. It keeps you on your toes.<\/p>\n<p>I remember when we achieved sending a million messages a day. Everything was barely holding itself together to which Silvio said \u2018\u2019Well then, I really don\u2019t know how we will be able to send ten million messages.\u2019\u2019 To which I said \u2018\u2019Oh you\u2019ll see\u2019\u2019 and rolled up my sleeves and eagerly tackled that challenge to prove to him that we can do it.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#6 Embrace the jack of all trades mindset&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<strong>Silvio:<\/strong>\u00a0It\u2019s normal for startup founders without resources to take on the role of a jack of all trades. I\u2019d say it\u2019s even a prerequisite for any kind of future success. In those early days it was just Izabel and me, and we covered everything from development and product to sales. Some would say that that is the con of bootstrapping but for me it\u2019s the pro of bootstrapping. The wealth of experience you get is immeasurable.<\/p>\n<p>I remember once, during one of Izabel\u2019s quitting crises, I said \u201cokay, I\u2019ll do just sales.\u201d So I started sending over a thousand emails to potential Italian customers. Since it was August and they were all on Ferragosto leave no one was replying. Once it ended, we started getting a bunch of emails back and our revenue skyrocketed. We were making money!<\/p>\n<p>However, it was crucial that we were both engineers because we could cover everything, from product to sales. It\u2019s easier for an engineer to cover sales than for sales to cover engineering \u2013 then they need more money to hire a team that will develop what they want. We could do that from the start and then try out other things.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#7 Learn by doing.

I left for lunch and never went back. I didn\u2019t have work experience besides this 4-hour gig \u2013 and I didn\u2019t exactly bring a lot of experience from there \u2013 so I had to work a lot and learn a lot with Infobip. And I still do.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, there are a lot of resources online, you can always learn and educate yourself around a topic. And as we\u2019re growing, there\u2019s always something new to learn: new organizational methodologies, new ways of developing a product. We\u2019re in a continuous learning loop.<\/p>\n<p>And nothing is unsolvable. That\u2019s how we operated then, and that\u2019s how we operate now. Since we\u2019ve had no outside help, we solved everything as it came along, by ourselves. We would start our day over coffee and discuss what needs to be done that day and then tackle it. And whatever we did, we knew nothing about it, so we learned constantly. Learning by doing. And that made us resilient.<\/p>\n<p>Resilience is the name of the game when it comes to bootstrapping.

I know that sounds like a logical thing to do, but I often see people doing the exact opposite.<\/p>\n<p>And I completely understand it, we\u2019re living in a world where for every problem you have a variety of solutions, from apps to SaaS, which is the exact opposite of how things were when we started. So you really need to know what you need in order not to get lost in the possibilities. Don\u2019t rush into things because they\u2019re the newest\/hottest, find a solution you need.

That\u2019s when you come up with some of the craziest ideas that turn out to be the best ones.<\/p>\n<p>For example, we started opening offices internationally very early on, around 2009, when my brother Roberto joined us full time as the third co-founder. Between 2008 and 2012 I was traveling 11 months a year all around the world, selling to operators, finding people, opening offices, and making sure it was all very cost effective. Which meant we weren\u2019t opening offices through logistic partners and lawyers, because that was too expensive. We did it ourselves or by sending our people there.<\/p>\n<p>And we didn\u2019t choose Europe or America, we focused more on Africa, LATAM, and APAC regions since they are heavily populated, easier to penetrate, and cheaper to achieve market entry in. This meant that our people were sent to the most unusual places, which they often didn\u2019t see coming. That was fun!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Izabel:<\/strong>\u00a0Yes, hustle mode is the real deal. I definitely loved it.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s more drive, the feedback loop is faster. Everything is more agile, solving tasks is quicker, and there\u2019s no slow down due to the number of individuals a task needs to go through. It\u2019s definitely easier to communicate, with less bureaucracy in the way.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve recently initiated these mission-based teams in Infobip, trying to replicate that startup mode through them. The goal is to have smaller, more agile teams that are less dependent on others. It\u2019s like having a bunch of startups within a large organization. It\u2019s gonna help us recreate that startup sense of urgency. It\u2019s very exciting.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_color=&#8221;#fafafa&#8221; full_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; sticky_row=&#8221;true&#8221; sticky_row_alignment=&#8221;top&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; class=&#8221;article&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221; shape_type=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; left_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; constrain_group_2=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_backdrop_filter=&#8221;none&#8221; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;static&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; column_padding_type=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_position=&#8221;default&#8221; row_position_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; row_position_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; pointer_events=&#8221;all&#8221;][vc_column_inner left_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; constrain_group_101=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; left_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_103=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; left_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_105=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/slush.org\/9-bootstrapping-lessons-for-early-stage-founders\/\">&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Read more about: 9 Bootstrapping Lessons for Early-Stage Founders &nbsp;&raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":2772,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[35,51],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2769"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2769"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2769\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3089,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2769\/revisions\/3089"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2772"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2769"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2769"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2769"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
