We don\u2019t really have enough time to completely replace that infrastructure. Maybe we should, for many reasons, someday in the midterm. But in the near term, I\u2019m more interested in finding solutions that reduce the carbon impact across the industries that exist right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This ranges from reducing livestock methane emissions to lab-grown meats.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at companies that use kelp to reduce methane from livestock mainly from cows and pigs. I\u2019m thoroughly supportive of lab-grown meats, but those are tricky, because they may take a huge amount of energy, not just electricity, but also other inputs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFoodtech is an explosive area of startup growth and I\u2019m excited about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><b>Decarbonization of Agriculture<\/b><\/h5>\n<p>\u201cInnovations in agriculture are a little bit trickier because some things are just good ideas and not necessarily great venture categories.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>The sphere has many promising innovations, from adjusting livestock feed to reduce emissions from digestive systems, to opportunities to reduce emissions through decreasing fertilizer inputs and capturing methane emissions from manure.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Haber Bosch process produces a massive amount of CO2 to make nitrogen fertilizer out of the air. It\u2019s super cool, it just turns out that it\u2019s terrible for the climate. Just like insulin, it changed the course of humanity, but we now need to remove that process. That\u2019s a venture opportunity, and we\u2019re already seeing companies doing it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Mobility<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><i>We spent a decade proving that we could decarbonize energy generation, and mobility is now going through a similar decarbonisation wave. A recent example is automotive \u2013 everything\u2019s going electric.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this transition happening where the tier two suppliers to automotive actually can\u2019t keep up. The big companies are not innovating.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>There already exists a large group of suppliers of parts to electric vehicles. Many of these suppliers have emerged with, and also without, the presence of ex-Tesla engineers and they\u2019re transforming the whole hierarchy of the supply chain for vehicles.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the vehicles with internal combustion engines are dependent on traditional players in the industry, EVs don\u2019t have something like 60% of the parts of a combustion engine. These emerging suppliers are EV-first \u2013 it\u2019s a whole industry swap out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>And the opportunity yet remains to be fully seized.\u00a0<\/i>\u201cThere\u2019s tons more money to be made there because there\u2019s so much doubt and a lot of people don\u2019t really know or believe it\u2019s happening.

And what probably puts those things into words and actions around, is you.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i>Value alignment may seem like a self-evident thing, but has a significant impact on how the company is run in practice. An evident distinction is in terms of orientation to strategy, pivots, and agility \u2013 some are more conservative and others much more casual about shifting things around.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAgile may sound like a cool word, like something you should be, but if it means that every two weeks your CEO tells you we\u2019re doing something different, that can be super complicated, and maybe not that valuable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>You also need to figure out exactly how deeply you want to live those values.<\/i>\u00a0\u201cAre you all for transparency? To what extent do you live those values?
