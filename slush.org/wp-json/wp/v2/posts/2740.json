This offers many opportunities, varying from energy management and source tracking to carbon footprint measuring software, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/carbon-accounting-comparison\/\">startups are acquiring funding left and right<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Decarbonization is present not just in how companies do their business or how consumers behave, but also in the energy sources used, as renewables are increasing their market share at an accelerating speed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn important notion is that renewables are actually also very economical \u2013 solar power is amongst the cheapest ways of generating energy in Europe, and so is wind power. It\u2019s not only good for the environment, but also good business,\u201d says Vapola.<\/p>\n<p>This brings major climate victories, but also a wide range of new optimization challenges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith rising pressure on decarbonization and efficiency, we see a strong role for AI technologies to help assess future scenarios, make the right trade-offs and above all, help manage the energy systems that will be more complex and integrated\u201d, says Herve Huisman, CEO and Founder of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gradyent.ai\/\">Gradyent<\/a>, the AI-powered energy analytics solution.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Trend 2: Decentralization<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The second prominent trend of decentralization is mainly driven by a mix of increasing demand, climate targets and the need to cut costs and secure energy supply. As the production of energy is decentralizing, energy storage is in the beginning of a similar path. In addition to larger-scale battery powerhouses like the Swedish\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/northvolt.com\/articles\/northvolt-equity-june2021\">Northvolt<\/a>, storage capacity is being searched from increasingly unexpected places. For example, many EV charging platforms like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.virta.global\/vehicle-to-grid-v2g\">Virta Ltd. are pioneering the so-called V2G<\/a>, vehicle-to-grid, that enables energy to be pushed back to the power grid from the battery of an electric car to leverage the excess storage capacity in EVs.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the currently limited yet high-cost energy storage possibilities, energy has always been generated on a level equal to usage. This balance was previously easier to optimize, as the sources were simple and few. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer one or a few providers whose generation is easy to optimize, but\u00a0the grid is constantly becoming more scattered and hence more complicated,\u201d Vapola elaborates.<\/p>\n<p>This has clear implications: \u201cIn our sector\u00a0[of district heating]\u00a0we see that 5-10 years ago, the energy systems were simple enough to be managed with relatively simple linear simulation and control systems\u201d, Gradyent\u2019s Huisman describes. \u201cThere were applications of AI, but they were still in the space of academia and R&amp;D. Today, AI is getting much higher on the agenda of the energy players who are looking for real benefit and impact.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As the share of renewables increases, factors like the weather have stepped into the equation. This creates forecasting and optimization problems, and the need for AI tools is blowing up \u2013 which is where digitization comes in.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Trend 3: Digitization<\/b><\/p>\n<p>As the problems to be solved are getting more complex and the evolving technology is offering new opportunities, platform businesses are emerging in droves. There are optimization and forecasting needs, but also a need to connect suppliers and end-users \u2013 translating into potential for digitization.<\/p>\n<p>Even though energy software startups are constantly finding new growth pockets within existing energy niches, the slowly-moving energy industry sets the boundaries to where digital products can go.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStill, there are technologies that are less dependent on existing infra that mostly operate on the consumer interface, and they\u2019re increasing as they\u2019re generally more scalable,\u201d Vapola notes.<\/p>\n<p>The digital solutions of today and tomorrow will be crucial in\u00a0managing the new complex equations and making sustainable energy accessible and affordable.\u00a0Energy\u2019s digital segments \u2013 SaaS, marketplace and ecommerce business models are changing the concept of energy products.

The technologies also benefit from existing infrastructure: \u201cCompared to other alternative technologies, such as hydrogen and fuel cells, e-mobility benefits from the pre-existing electric infrastructure for energy transport and distribution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An important theme within eMobility is the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.virta.global\/vehicle-to-grid-v2g\">V2G<\/a>\u00a0technology, which is also key in the transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cThe transition in global energy production to zero-carbon variable renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, requires additional flexibility in energy consumption to withhold the power balance,\u201d Karppinen notes. \u201cThe charging of electric vehicles is a great globally increasing source of flexibility for the energy system.

Marketplace &amp; ecommerce is a more defined category with space for a limited number of players, but also one that has been on the rise due to the B2C boom.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2754&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]As energy has long been a CAPEX-driven industry with national interests and high barriers to entry, startups\u2019 opportunities have usually been in B2B \u2013 and still are. 70,2% of digital energy startups founded after 2010 within SaaS, marketplace and ecommerce verticals are solely B2B startups.<\/p>\n<p>The tide is turning, however.
