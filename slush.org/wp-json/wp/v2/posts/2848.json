It\u2019s the customer metric that\u2019s most connected to your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>CLV provides insight into the revenue you generate over the lifetime of your business relationship with a customer. You can also apply it to segments of customers. It takes account of the investment needed to acquire and retain a customer and reveals the profit you should be able to extract.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Why is CLV important?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]It is tempting to put all your efforts into customer acquisition and making big sales.

A business that prioritizes CLV should expect a wider end of the funnel. It\u2019s wider because fewer customers have fallen off.

You calculate this by taking how many customers you had at the beginning of a period and then subtracting the number of customers you have at the end. Then divide the difference by how many customers were at the beginning and multiply by one hundred.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take the example of a sushi restaurant.

What isn\u2019t taken into account, however, is the possibility of returning inactive customers.<\/p>\n<p>This model, then, has some drawbacks. It doesn\u2019t take into account the different kinds of customer journeys. It discounts customers who may buy from you again.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Predictive customer lifetime value<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Through using the latest customer analytics technologies, you will be able to predict future CLV.

Through segmenting customers into groups, you will be able to calculate CLV for each of them. The benefit to your business is you will be able to see which groups provide higher CLV and target them accordingly. It will also point out groups on which to focus your efforts to improve CLV.<\/p>\n<p>To segment your customers, you will need to lean on your database of customer details.

This is because of the dreaded churn. Show your customer-facing teams what your calculations have revealed. They will be able to make improvements to the service they provide and drive better CLV.<\/p>\n<p>Customers are put off by poor support.

A longer relationship will result in a higher CLV.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#2: Marketing focus<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Understanding your customers allows you to be efficient in your marketing efforts. CLV data can teach you many\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/10-marketing-lessons-for-every-early-stage-founder\/\">marketing lessons<\/a>. Through your CLV calculations by customer segments, you\u2019ll be better equipped to decide on marketing priorities. You will know which customers provide the most income, thereby boosting your CLV.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#3: Under promise, over deliver<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Customers are much more likely to offer return business if they feel their expectations have been surpassed. If there\u2019s something your business offers that\u2019s not 100% deliverable, don\u2019t promise it.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a customer orders a product on your website but then receives an email apologizing because you\u2019re out of stock. This is either because of a sub-par retail inventory management system or lackluster website updating protocols. Don\u2019t disappoint active customers or your CLV will suffer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#4: Quality Experiences<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>CLV helps you identify which customer experiences are the cream of the crop, and which are the bottom of the barrel. It\u2019ll give you the insight needed to make decisions around which channels customers are engaging with. You may find your highest value customers prefer to engage via social media, for example, so you\u2019ll know to prioritize investment there.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>To sum up\u2026<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The purpose of these calculations is to find ways to boost your fiscal performance.
