These answers are not exclusive to each other.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I am an Indian-American woman raised in Seattle, as well as a US citizen living in Denmark, serving as the CEO of a UK company. I find myself fortunate to have been able to experience a variety of cultures and work with diverse individuals throughout my career. The places where I am most comfortable have been the teams and companies where I have felt welcome. This is why I believe this is important for us to practice at Humio.\u00a0As foundational values at Humio, diversity and inclusion \u2014 more specifically, proactive inclusion \u2014 is the lifeblood of our success.[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;At Humio, we practice a culture of proactive inclusion, and it shows itself in everything we do: from our hiring practices to product development to our customer relationships.&#8221;][vc_column_text]Founded in 2016, Humio offers a log management solution that gives ITOps, DevOps, and SecOps teams complete, real-time observability of their environment. The modern, purpose-built tool features innovative data storage and in-memory search\/query engine technologies, enabling our customers to log everything and find anything in their log data. The value of Humio is evident in our strong customer retention and continual growth of our existing base.<\/p>\n<p>At Humio, we practice a culture of proactive inclusion, and it shows itself in everything we do: from our hiring practices to product development to our customer relationships.\u00a0Proactive inclusion is what gives the company its strength, enabling us to compete toe-to-toe with long-established, legacy log management solutions.<\/p>\n<p>When I explain this to people, they usually tell me that they have a Chief Diversity Officer or that they\u2019re going to hire one. But that\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s human nature to lean towards people who think, act, value, and believe the same things (or very similarly) as you do. Building a startup is no different.<\/p>\n<p>People have a tendency to hire their friends and friends of friends. When they do that, they bring together people with similar interests, backgrounds, and ways of perceiving the world. The result is an institutionalized unconscious bias that restricts the art of creative thought around building products and solving problems. Put another way, the company\u2019s approach to innovating and problem-solving is severely limited to a narrow perspective that\u2019s continually reinforced.[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;Not only do the people at Humio come from different cultures and backgrounds, they are willing to extend beyond their comfort zones and develop a diverse skill set.&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-upper-margin b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\">\n<div class=\"l-columns__item\">\n<div class=\"h-wysiwyg-html\" data-scheme-target=\"\">\n<p>At Humio, we celebrate people\u2019s differences. We value eccentricity and actively foster diversity of thought. We want everyone to feel safe and comfortable expressing their opinions and opposing viewpoints. That means bringing together folks who don\u2019t look like each other, who don\u2019t wear the same clothes, who don\u2019t come from the same countries, or engage in the same hobbies. We have people from a variety of countries and cultures, and there\u2019s beauty to that. There\u2019s beauty in combining a lot of different ways to solve problems. People from different cultures and ethnicities bring different approaches to problem-solving, and proactive inclusion is a way to not only embrace that but to foster and encourage that.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also a more pragmatic reason for practicing proactive inclusion when building a startup. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to run a successful tech business if you don\u2019t have different profiles on your founding team. The founding team may consist of talented engineers who build an amazing product, but customers don\u2019t flock to your product simply because you built it. You also need people to market it and sell it. As a CEO with a background in marketing, I too brought a different knowledge set to Humio\u2019s founding team.<\/p>\n<p>Not only do the people at Humio come from different cultures and backgrounds, they are willing to extend beyond their comfort zones and develop a diverse skill set.\u00a0When we started Humio, we intentionally stuck to a small team. We had 15 people, and everyone was expected to do whatever needed to be done. People were doing engineering, but also customer support and sales and other things besides. It gave our engineering team a good generalist attitude, but also honed their proactivity. If something was wrong with the product, they fixed it. That bias toward action is what makes Humio a quality product, and that attitude continues strong today.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s important to realize that proactive inclusion extends beyond your payroll to include your customers. Successful products aren\u2019t built in silos. What drives Humio as a company today is knowing who uses our product, how they use it, why they use it, and what they\u2019re looking for. The customer is an essential part of a very tight product feedback loop. As we serve diverse groups of users as customers, having a team with varied skills, backgrounds, and profiles is an advantage. We have a better understanding of the markets we sell to and we build a better product.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Final words of advice&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]When building a startup, I advise doing so with a diverse mindset from the start. Allow the leadership team to lay the foundation for the culture that you will develop as time goes on. Begin from a place of diversity and inclusion, and proactive inclusion will become a natural practice that guides the company to success.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Geeta has over 20 years of software industry experience and is passionate about creating great products for software developers.
