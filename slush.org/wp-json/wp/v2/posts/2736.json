Numerous leaders from the ecosystem have spoken at Slush about how they turned their startups into global companies, and the tricks that helped them get there.

That can often go wrong. What you want to be sure of before you start accelerating the growth of your company is [that] you\u2019ve built something that people really love.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Estonian ride-sharing unicorn Bolt did exactly this \u2013 they laser-focused on getting the business right in their home market in Tallinn for the first two years. In the words of Bolt Founder and CEO Markus Villig: \u201cWhen we got it right, we almost immediately started to expand\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>But how exactly do you know whether you\u2019ve gotten a product users love?<\/p>\n<p>P\/M fit is an elusive concept and hard to define, one important guideline may however be to focus on retention instead of top line growth. It may seem like you\u2019re having constant new users but be wary of excessive focus on tracking revenue growth. It may look great, but as Alstr\u00f6mer says, \u201cyou can\u2019t look at just the top line growth numbers, you need to look at the growth accounting or the sum of all growth numbers. How many new people are coming into my product? How many people stop using my product? How many people come back and start using my product again? What\u2019s the sum of all that? That\u2019s the number you have to look at.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In other words, it\u2019s all about retention. Casey Winters, CPO and growth advisor to companies of the likes of Reddit, Canva, and Airbnb, is an expert in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slush.org\/article\/6-best-product-lessons-from-slush-stages\/\">converting first time users<\/a>\u00a0from one-time users into loyal customers. It should be one of your top product priorities to get the retention rate high before you expand.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3sVcqcRvhIQ\">Laying The Foundation for Sustainable Growth by Gustaf Alstr\u00f6mer<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uHg7K-M36Bc\">Fireside Between the Founders of Stripe and Bolt: Building Global Companies<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DrmgZLj1zfo\">Casey Winters: Why Customer Onboarding is the Most Crucial Part of Your Growth Strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">For some more product insights:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/slush.org\/6-best-product-lessons-from-slush-stages\/\">6 Best Product Lessons from Slush Stages<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\"b-base b-base--no-lower-margin\">\n<div class=\"b-base__container\">\n<div class=\"l-columns l-columns--h-center\" data-column-count=\"1\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#2: Expand through experimentation and develop an expansion blueprint on the way&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Local and global P\/M fit are two different things; once you\u2019ve reached P\/M fit in your local market you\u2019ll need to build-measure-learn your way to a global one.<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>International money transfer service WorldRemit scaled incredibly quickly, growing to 140 countries in just 5 years. Their first Product Manager Alice Newton Rex, is an advocate of rapid expansion: \u201cLaunch early and learn. There\u2019s no more impactful way to see what\u2019s going to influence users in a new market than to actually get some of them using your product and to be able to see what\u2019s performing and what isn\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once they saw how users responded, they were able to start optimizing and customizing their product to each local market. For example, this approach allowed WorldRemit to learn that to gain local users\u2019 trust they needed to adjust their sign-up forms to offer the locally preferred style. New users didn\u2019t always understand the UK format used by default in WorldRemit\u2019s sign-ups and dropped the process.<\/p>\n<p>The significance of experimentation as key to growth held true for Glovo as well, and allowed them to uncover some of the crucial differences in how their product was being used in different markets.\u00a0Glovo\u2019s offering of not just food delivery but everything in the store delivery (i.e. flowers, clothing, etc.) proved essential in Latin America, where people were more used to getting deliveries by phone. Since the value-proposition was already clear for locals, Glovo simply had to transfer these deliveries online.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Obviously, there\u2019s a caveat \u2013 don\u2019t be reckless.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>WorldRemit first expanded into markets they had natural ties to such as Zimbabwe and Somalia where their founders are from, playing to their strengths. Similarly, Bolt recognized that the ride-hailing market wasn\u2019t a winner-takes-all market. Instead of going in guns blazing, they carefully picked the cities to expand to.<\/p>\n<p>Expanding too quickly can be a problem if done incorrectly and you don\u2019t have local product-market fit. Wolt\u2019s CEO and co-founder Miki Kuusi suggests doing only one expansion at a time:\u00a0\u201cotherwise you will be making too many mistakes \u2013 when you have figured out the expansion blueprint, then you can do many [simultaneously]\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gotten your expansion blueprint down, go for it. New markets almost always have something up their sleeve for you in one aspect or another. The more sophisticated your risk-management and expansion processes are, the more certain\u00a0you can be that\u00a0you\u2019re set up for success.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WDLv0NbIfFA\">How to Scale Your Product to 140 Countries in 5 Years by Alice Newton-Rex from WorldRemit<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/374872011\">Founding CEOs of Wolt &amp; Smartly.io reflect on the first five years of expansion<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TtD2kHqlByA\">The Handbook for Expanding to Emerging Markets by Oscar Pierre, Co-founder &amp; CEO, of Glovo<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uHg7K-M36Bc\">Fireside Between the Founders of Stripe and Bolt: Building Global Companies<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#3: Scale your culture with expansion \u201cSWAT\u201d-teams&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Scaling culture should be a part of your expansion blueprint, by the way.<\/p>\n<p>Checkout.com is growing exponentially annually. Guillaume Pousaz, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, emphasizes how important maintaining culture while scaling is. \u201cIf you have the right foundation of the business in the beginning you will naturally attract people, but if you don\u2019t scale the culture that message, what people join you for in the early days, might just kind of disappear.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Pousaz, Checkout.com is notorious for doing loads of interviews. In 2019 when Pousaz spoke at Slush, the company hired 30 people a month but every person was still interviewed by the top management. Pousaz underlines that they look for the \u201ccultural fit\u201d and are always \u201chiring with the heart\u201d: if someone\u2019s good but selfish they\u2019ll give this person a pass.<\/p>\n<p>You not only have to attract the right kind of people but also create an environment where they can prosper. Klarna\u2019s Co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemi\u0105tkowski emphasizes the value of finding the right fit, especially for the employees: \u201cYou have to attract passionate people, give them the right environment and space, and allow them to be creative\u201d, he says and adds, \u201cFor them, it has to be crystal clear what they\u2019re doing, what we are doing [as a company] and why, and for them to have ownership\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Then how\u00a0<i>do<\/i>\u00a0you scale culture? To sustain culture, Wolt\u2019s Miki Kuusi recommends starting slowly, then picking up speed. Going from 80 to 200 doesn\u2019t feel so different from going from 250 to 700 within 12 months, if you\u2019ve built the foundation well. \u201cWhat has surprised me constantly is how well you\u2019re able to bring similarly minded people to the company, if you build up the processes right, how you recruit people; even in very weird places.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Kuusi has two particular tips:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Build an expansion team.\u00a0<\/b>Wolt has an expansion \u201cSWAT\u201d-team of 12 people only working on recruiting, onboarding, and training people in new countries\u00a0they set up.\u00a0Their ability to find people that really\u00a0<i>feel\u00a0<\/i>like Wolt and want to do things in a similar way is crucial\u00a0for scaling culture while expanding.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use existing people to hire for the new roles.<\/b>\u00a0Having operations in 19 countries like Wolt did in 2019\u00a0when Kuusi talked at Slush\u00a0means you have almost 19 of everything, whether that be operations managers, marketing people, or general managers. Use these people to hire new people.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/374880968\">Founder Story: A Bootstrapped Unicorn, Checkout.com\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PQ8MNJki6vM\">Scaling the Experience: Fireside Chat with the Co-Founder of Klarna<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/374872011\">Founding CEOs of Wolt &amp; Smartly.io reflect on the first five years of expansion<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0nugcLAAhto\">Fireside: Miki Kuusi, Co-Founder and CEO of Wolt \u2013 From Launch to Unicorn in 5 years<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/42edLxjyQLTBXjWqK3Yomi?si=bd9dbc7fd89349e6\">Soaked by Slush Episode #20 Sofia Nunes | How to feed and grow culture<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#4: When hiring in a field you aren\u2019t an expert in\u2026ask an expert&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Kuusi\u2019s second tip brings us to one obvious insight: you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. Successful expansion is to a large extent tied to your personal growth and ability to build a successful team around you. Niko Bonatsos, Partner at General Catalyst, aptly points out that as a founder \u201cthe job description changes every 6 months\u201d so you need to ask yourself, \u201cwhat do you do to invest yourself?\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In his experience, the best founders in his portfolio companies, like Stripe and Livongo, understand that they don\u2019t know everything and they need to constantly improve themselves. As companies scale, founders can no longer do it all \u2013 nor should they. In Bonatsos\u2019 experience, good founders ask advice from business coaches, advisors, or have mentors who\u2019ve \u2018been there done that\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>When hiring specifically, they work with advisors in all the functions they need to hire and ask simple questions like \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to hire a VP of engineering. What are the mistakes that I\u2019m probably going to make that I should be aware of?\u201d as Bonatsos describes, and highlights that you should use domain experts\u2019 help in the interview process. This applies more broadly when hiring for new markets. You don\u2019t know the market well, so asking local experts to help make that first hire can prove essential.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The timing of hiring also matters<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When asked what teams that have scaled well have in common, Bonatsos underlines the importance of putting energy into hiring early enough. \u201cThe biggest mistake I see is people who don\u2019t enjoy hiring, so they put it off. They think that their board is going to do it for them, or that a recruiter is going to do it. And it never really happens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Your procrastination will come and get you in the long run \u2013 if you put off recruiting for too long you\u2019ll eventually face a lot of bottlenecks down the line when you and other founders can\u2019t anymore cover all the functions needed for expansion and scaling. So also ask for that expert advice in hiring sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IpBYQ5ZFR9c\">Niko Bonatsos &amp; Harry Stebbings: Be Smart &amp; Scale Sustainably<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#5: Take expansion shortcuts and include a locally relevant payment method&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]WorldRemit has a wealth of experience when it comes to expansion.

This allowed them to see whether their product could take off before taking on the tightly regulated money transfer business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Partner with local brands.\u00a0<\/b>Creating strategic partnerships with local brands can quickly build trust in your brand by association.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Ruthlessly prioritize user experience improvements.\u00a0<\/b>Simple as that!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Over everything, however, Newton-Rex emphasizes the importance of locally relevant payment methods: \u201cIf you don\u2019t offer locally relevant payment methods, your product is sure to fail.\u201d This may sound niche, but every company has payment involved at some point. Offering the most convenient payment method is absolutely essential when acquiring users in new markets.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, offering a locally preferred payment method turned out to be more important than having your product available in the local language. WorldRemit customers could go through the entire complicated sign up process but decide not to use the service when they weren\u2019t offered a payment method they were comfortable with. Moreover, once WorldRemit adjusted their approach\u00a0and offered the right payment method, those who had begun the signup process and dropped off would return and complete it.<\/p>\n<p>In a whole different realm, food-delivery service Glovo\u2019s CEO and co-founder Oscar Pierre learned the same lesson when launching in Latin America. Latin American people prefer paying in cash. Glovo had no cash option on delivery, and eventually had to pull back. \u201cWe had to develop cash\u00a0[payment options]\u00a0almost overnight\u201d, Pierre remembers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WDLv0NbIfFA\">How to Scale Your Product to 140 Countries in 5 Years by Alice Newton-Rex from WorldRemit<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TtD2kHqlByA\">The Handbook for Expanding to Emerging Markets by Oscar Pierre, Co-founder &amp;
