In hindsight, that course set many things in motion in his life. According to Vartiainen, the beginning of the millennium marked the first wave in quantum computing and sparked a lifelong fascination in him for the topic. \u201cRight now we are experiencing the second wave. We are reaping the fruits of the studies we started twenty years ago.\u201d Vartiainen explains.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;The floorball game that changed the future of quantum computing&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Vartiainen worked in the field of software applications after finishing his PhD in 2005 at Aalto University. Meanwhile, a former course mate Mikko M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen did pioneering research work at the world-renowned Quantum Computing and Devices (QCD) lab. The inciting conversation for a business soon to become IQM was held outside a floorball rink three years ago. \u201cWe had always joked about a business venture together\u201d, Vartiainen says. M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen got strong encouragement from Risto Siilasmaa and Ilyas Khan to start a business around his work at QCD. M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen asked if Vartiainen might be interested to join. \u201cI recall saying \u2018Let\u2019s do it!\u2019\u201d, Vartiainen laughs.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Quantum physics \u2013 Finally trending!&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Vartiainen and three other doctors in quantum physics started IQM as a spinoff company of Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. \u201cThe title \u2018entrepreneur\u2019 somehow sounds a bit foreign to me. I guess the conventional connotation brings me an idea of young people with their laptops\u201d Vartiainen reflects on his newfound status. \u201cMy background as a researcher has provided a good foundation for entrepreneurship, although very different things are at focus.\u201d Vartiainen finds his work at IQM rewarding: \u201cThis field has been a topic for academic research for years, now it\u2019s under huge amounts of interest and investment.

A start-up needs a capable team in order to function.\u201d According to him, Aalto University provided important assistance in the early moments of the company: \u201cThere are people who supported us. It\u2019s important that close-by in Otaniemi there\u2019s help around.\u201d Vartiainen and his team also benefited greatly from Micronova, the joint facility of Aalto and VTT. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way for companies just getting off the ground to start their operation.\u201d Vartiainen emphasizes that Aalto\u2019s high level of education in quantum physics is paramount for IQM\u2019s existence. \u201cWithout the advanced level math, physics, and quantum courses we wouldn\u2019t have this level of research and innovations needed in our operations.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Maria Lavonen,<br \/>\nLightopsy&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2649&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]With a background in physics, business strategy, and international marketing at Aalto University\u2019s predecessor, Helsinki University of Technology, Maria Lavonen is an expert in commercializing technology. After 15 years in Med Tech, Lavonen found her way back to Aalto. \u201cI was at a crossroads in my career and heard of an interesting research project through my networks.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;A game-changing biopsy&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<p class=\"p1\">Lavonen joined Lightopsy, a project built around an innovative technology that enables more accurate biopsy acquisition with AI-based tissue recognition. The project is a collaboration between Aalto University, University of Oulu, and the Oulu University Hospital and led by Miika Nieminen, Ph.D., Professor of Medical Physics, Chief Physicist from the University of Oulu and Heikki Nieminen, assistant professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering from Aalto University.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe research got wind under its wings after a small-scale project in Oulu. It gave encouragement to believe this technology could really make a difference.\u201d Lavonen says. \u201cWe then applied Business Finland\u2019s \u2018Research to business\u2019 funding, which we got, and have now wrapped up the project successfully.\u201d<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;The road to success is paved with collaboration&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<p class=\"p1\">According to Lavonen, Aalto University was able to offer valuable support in commercialization and investor funding. \u201cWe benefited from Aalto\u2019s start-up center and Aalto Innovation Service took part in a steering group. We were able to evaluate the research from many angles, how it could be applied to the market.\u201d The interdisciplinary Aalto ecosystem has been a great environment for Lightopsy. \u201cThere are so many opportunities to collaborate with industrial designers and business experts. It\u2019s tremendously valuable.\u201d Lavonen concludes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Working as a business developer closely with a team of researchers, Lavonen sees collaboration as natural. \u201cThe researchers are top professionals in this field. My responsibility is to think of the business side. I see working together as a huge asset, and enjoy when people are able to focus on what they do best.\u201d Lavonen holds an entrepreneurial mindset as an important asset. \u201cTo me, it means that things will get finished. It\u2019s a very important attitude in a young company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Lightopsy, the future looks promising. \u201cWe got great results during the Business Finland -funded project.\u201d Lightopsy will next focus on further commercializing the recent work in product development. \u201cCollaboration with University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital has been smooth, and it excites me to think what this technology can do for example in cancer research with more accurate biopsies,\u201d Lavonen says.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Nagarajan Subramaniyam, Xfold imaging&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2650&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]A lifelong passion for problem-solving in the field of mathematics and physics has led Nagarajan Subramaniyam to an extensive career as a researcher, and more recently to entrepreneurship. Originally from India, Subramaniyam moved to South Korea in 2005 for his Ph.D. and arrived in Finland and Aalto University as a postdoc researcher in 2009.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Tiny droplets, huge impact&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<p class=\"p1\">Subramaniyam\u2019s expertise lies in the smallest of things: Nanotechnology and nanoscience. His company, Xfold Imaging is a spin-out from Aalto University and the University of Helsinki. The company was founded around an innovation that enables enhanced accuracy in studying cellular structures and bio-molecules. Their nano-coated glass slide enables better imaging without expensive super-resolution microscopes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shortly after arriving in Aalto, Subramaniyam started to explore Raman spectroscopy and imaging. He had been thinking about how to see small droplets that are below 300 nanometers, without adjusting the microscope. \u201cI got an idea. Why don\u2019t we modify the glass? All the problems come down to not being able to see the smallest things. Could we improve the sensitivity of the microscope?\u201d Subramaniyam got in touch with Elina Ikonen, Professor at the institution of Biomedicine at the University of Helsinki, and worked from 2014 to 2015 with initial funding to showcase his findings on the topic. \u201cProgress was good. We started to explore different microscopes, collaborated with universities to see if we could push the technology further.\u201d<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Sweet spot in the start-up center&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<p class=\"p1\">The team applied for funding from Business Finland and received it for 18 months. \u201cFrom the very start, we received good mentorship from Aalto. When applying for the funding, we got help in preparing the application. The support for the business side was important.\u201d Xfold is located at the start-up center and does its manufacturing and R&amp;D at Micronova lab. \u201cIt\u2019s a great advantage to have the center close to the lab.
