But the challenge with this is that as a designer or entrepreneur you will always question whether the product you released is good enough to truly test your hypotheses\u00a0once your MVP is in the hands of users.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Certainly, building an MVP can help assess how customers feel about an idea\/hypothesis. It can validate that an idea has potential. But in healthcare, the scope needed to make a minimum\u00a0<i>viable<\/i>\u00a0product is often far greater than the MVP approach implies. It cannot be about \u2018<i>moving fast and breaking things.\u2019\u00a0<\/i>The product experience needs to build trust in every interaction \u2013 whether that is meeting face to face with a doctor via video, chatting with a nurse through text, or reading the results of your last lab test.\u00a0 As a scaleup, we also need to do that quickly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This requires going deeper and beyond the MVP to the value proposition.\u00a0From looking at the user and utilization to external factors like healthcare reimbursement models and understanding the interoperability of the tech; to baking in the go-to-market (GTM) strategy at the start so we can understand how, and if, it will deliver for the business, patients, healthcare professionals, and the system. Every facet plays a critical role in healthcare. Everything has to be about delivering tangible value, benefits, and products that our patients and healthcare professionals\u00a0want and need, so how can you do that at the pace of a startup?<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;The Kry product pathway&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]We have stripped back the traditional MVP methodology and taken elements from shared experiences to redefine how we can deliver products into the hands of thousands of healthcare professionals and millions of patients. At Kry, it is a structure that places the patients\u2019 or healthcare professionals\u2019 (users\u2019) experience into the central process of product development.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our three-stage product pathway focuses on these core principles:\u00a0<strong>Frame. Create. Deliver.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is a common and shared process that defines our path to \u2018yes\u2019 and achieving a world-class user experience from the start. It does this by providing rules, norms, and methods by which a team makes decisions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We have prioritized defining a shared language for the key steps of our process across R&amp;D and we work consistently to evolve this together. We set a clear process around each phase that enables us to assess and test if we have solved the right problem. Do we have the right solution? Do we have the right execution and GTM strategy?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This approach allows us to build confidence in the scope well beyond a traditional MVP, build momentum towards delivery, and ship with clarity and speed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#1 Frame&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]The \u2018Frame\u2019 stage enables us to gather insights, assess the problem, and create hypotheses.

The stage at which we consider if what we intend to deliver is going to help us meet our mission of\u00a0<i>fast forwarding the future health\u00a0<\/i>and the vision of<i>\u00a0great healthcare for everyone<\/i>. This stage is often led by a small team of cross-functional experts unburdened by dependency on existing work, teams, or systems \u2013 a Kry task force.

From our own care provision, we knew that some patients preferred to speak to their clinician over text rather than video. It\u2019s particularly useful for patients who need help or reassurance while on the go (they might have a poor connection or can\u2019t find somewhere private to speak).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A lean and readied Kry task force was created to condense the development process, gain speed and minimize risk. This allowed us to quickly\u00a0<i>frame<\/i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>create<\/i>\u00a0a Nurse Chat experience that could be released to a control group in Sweden. To ship this \u2018MVP\u2019 we needed an experience for patients to chat with nurses, a method for nurses to accept chats and chat with patients, and a reasonable path to earning revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once we were confident in understanding how comfortable users and clinicians were with the new feature, the task force then turned to iterate and scale the value proposition, looking at how to drive efficiencies and offer immediate access to healthcare professionals across Sweden. This included interoperability and utilization of the product, onboarding healthcare professionals, and implementing reimbursement models to generate income.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the chat is how efficient it is proving to be in helping us connect more patients to healthcare professionals. Initial results have shown that the number of meetings per hour carried out by a nurse via chat rather than by video almost doubled. This means that we can see more patients per hour and keep waiting times lower for patients \u2013 improving efficiency and providing immediate access.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Learn fast&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]With the scalable\u00a0<i>Frame to Deliver\u00a0<\/i>model, we develop in the real world, enabling us to iterate and adjust asynchronously.
