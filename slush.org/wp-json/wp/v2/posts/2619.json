I\u2019ll open up our vault of data and best practices about the fundraising part here.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Key learning 1: understand the fundraising as a process and a funnel&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]What has helped a lot of our founders to understand and manage the fundraising process better is to see the whole process in a similar manner as a sales or a marketing process, with a related sales or marketing funnel attached. First, you have a big crowd of all the potential customers (a long list of investors), then the process goes through different steps and the funnel narrows until there are only the ones left who end up investing in your company.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what the funnel usually looks like for our portfolio companies in light of numbers.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2621&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]Just like with sales, it\u2019s extremely important for founders to be realistic about the amount of work and prospects needed to come up even with a single paying customer (or investor), and track the metrics and tasks at different stages of the process.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s also essential to realize, is that even though you\u2019re putting together that long list of investors, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re expecting or even wanting to raise funding from all of those funds. In contrast to traditional sales, you have a very limited amount of the product that you\u2019re about to sell.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it makes sense to use a larger list of prospective buyers to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>practice your sales and build confidence<\/li>\n<li>get a sense of what the overall demand is in the market<\/li>\n<li>get a sense of what the different buyers are like to work with<\/li>\n<li>utilize the social aspects to get you the optimal buyer and price.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In short, you might not want to pitch the VC of your dreams right out of the gates, but rather late when you\u2019ve perfected your sales and they might\u2019ve already heard good rumors about you from the previous investors you\u2019ve talked to.<\/p>\n<p>What makes the fundraising process different and the funnel approach so crucial to fundraising is the fact that you want to manage the prospects and move them through the stages in a controlled manner. I\u2019ll explain a bit more about that later on, but for now:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>understand that fundraising is a process to be managed and measured at different stages of the funnel, and<\/li>\n<li>at the simplest, have a Google Sheet of the investors at different stages with shared access between your startup and your existing investors.

If you\u2019re lucky enough to already have existing investors on board, those are going to be some of your most valuable assets during the fundraising. Your job as a founder then partially becomes to push them to do as much of the leg work as possible and help you open the right doors.<\/p>\n<p>Just like managing your other co-workers, figure out what tasks need to be accomplished at which stages of the process, who\u2019d be best at taking care of them, and start allocating activities and deadlines to your investors. Expect your investors to help at least with the following things:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Help you build the narrative for the round (story, round goals, timeline)<\/li>\n<li>Spar you on the deck<\/li>\n<li>Help you build a long list of investors<\/li>\n<li>Introduce you to the investors they add on the list<\/li>\n<li>Help you drive the discussion and navigate the different funds\u2019 idiosyncrasies<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Do you have an investor on board with a PR background and expertise in storytelling? Good. Ask them to give some suggestions on the narrative of the round.<\/p>\n<p>Have an investor who\u2019s well connected with the VCs in the market you\u2019re thinking about expanding to? Great. Ask them to add 15 potential investors to the shared prospect list by Friday. Remember to ask but also to listen to your investors as they have a live pulse on the market. Sometimes the best feedback you might receive is not about who to pitch to but not to pitch at all and focus on growth for a few more months.<\/p>\n<p>While your existing investors might not have a value-added approach when it comes to, for example, scaling the sales and marketing of a startup, fundraising should be the one thing they know really well. If your investor is not pulling their weight when it\u2019s easiest for them to help out, you might want to think about whether that is the investor you want to have in your corner when the going gets real tough later on.[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;Key takeaway: \u201cYour existing investors are probably the most knowledgeable people you know in terms of fundraising, so utilize their expertise and help as much as you can.\u201d&#8221;][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Key learning 3: understand the nature of your product and your buyer&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Just like in any sales out there, it kinda helps if you understand the person you\u2019re selling to. What are they aiming to buy, what are key factors they\u2019re looking at when making the decision, what makes them tick?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d probably need 10 volumes to open up the inner workings of an \u201caverage VC\u201d, but I\u2019ll stick with opening up a bit the social aspects of the fundraising situation.<\/p>\n<p>So, you might have multiple, highly-competitive individuals searching for the startups that have the potential to be the outliers, to become the next unicorns, and return the whole fund. Those individuals then might cooperate or syndicate or they might fiercely compete against each other. If your startup ends up being the next Airbnb, it\u2019s not enough that they were the ones to miss it, but it was their competitor that got the track record of investing in Airbnb and thus a larger part of the following, sweet, sweet deal flow. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to get invested in by the people who invested in Airbnb, right?<\/p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the limited amount of the product called \u201cthe unique possibility to invest in your product at this exact point in time\u201d. What\u2019s bound to happen every now and then, is that the rational evaluation and lengthy and careful decision making processes give away to stronger, social occurrences \u2013 think FOMO and long lines of people after toilet paper or subscription to Superhuman.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you probably don\u2019t want your future investors or board members to be complete, irrational messes when they decide to invest in you, but you should understand and utilize the social aspects to some extent. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so crucial to manage the fundraising as a process and as a funnel, and have as many of the funds at the same stage of the funnel as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Why? Four big reasons.\u00a0<\/strong><\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Competition<\/strong>. As mentioned before, the social aspects of getting investors to potentially compete against each other. That won\u2019t happen if the other one is getting the first pitch while the other one is already drafting up term sheets.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Syndication<\/strong>. You will probably need multiple investors to get your round together, and thus for the same reasons as with the competition, it\u2019s crucial to try and have them at the same stage of the funnel, when it comes the time to make the final decisions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Momentum<\/strong>. This is in a way a combination of A and B but stands for the overall momentum that you as a founder are able to build for the round. Even if you have high interest and momentum in the initial talks, the momentum might wear off at different stages if you, for instance, either delay or rush the process too much.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Save time and energy<\/strong>. Building a company is a marathon, so you don\u2019t want to spend too much time and energy on the sprint that fundraising is. Don\u2019t go for scattered, aimless discussions over the course of several months, but have a coordinated, efficient operation. That allows you to spend time where it matters, building the company, while signaling the same thing to your future investors.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Having an honest and transparent line of communications to your existing investors is key to a lot of things mentioned in this article, but especially to the inner and inter-workings of VCs during your round.[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;Key takeaway: \u201cBuild momentum, move funds in the funnel at the same time, and maximize opportunities for competition and syndication.\u201d&#8221;][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Key learning 4: keep it simple yet ambitious and well thought-through, and prepare for rejections and iterations&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]You\u2019ve now utilized the help from your existing investors to build the narrative and a long list of investors, and now you\u2019re just getting the deck and data room in shape. The internet is filled with content surrounding all that, so let me give my two quick pointers on this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus heavily on building a vision that\u2019s ambitious enough, inspiring enough, and clear enough. That\u2019s the vision that you\u2019ll be selling for a long time, whether it\u2019s the customers, potential team members, or investors.<\/li>\n<li>Have a well thought-through, backtracked plan on how you\u2019ll get there. Ok, so you want to be the leading player to democratize app development by 2024. How do you get there from 2022? How many rounds do you aim to raise until then? What are you aiming to do with the round following this one? If you\u2019ll use this round to expand to the US, why and how exactly are you doing it?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Again, it might help to think about this from the point-of-view of the investor. Am I pitching a vision that\u2019s big enough to return their whole fund, and is our plan for getting there clear and credible enough?<\/p>\n<p>Another final remark. Dealing with rejections and being very open to feedback is key to being a successful founder, so keep that in mind also when fundraising, and don\u2019t take it personally. Bad founders might get discouraged or defensive over rejections or critical feedback, while the best founders usually get encouraged and learn from it to improve for the next time.<\/p>\n<p>So ask for feedback, learn from the rejections, tweak the narrative or the target fund, and get back in there negotiating stronger than ever. Here are the most common reasons for rejection based on the data of our portfolio companies.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2622&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]While \u201ctraction\u201d and \u201ctoo early\u201d might be the most common reasons, they can also be the easiest excuses to give. In all honesty, the team is a very common reason funding rounds are passed on by funds, but often VCs don\u2019t have it in them to tell that straight up. If the VCs are giving you an unclear, made-up reason, push them to give you the truth or ask your existing investors to inquire. Even if it ends up being \u201cthe team\u201d, you might get good hints on what a certain VC doesn\u2019t like about your team. Once again, don\u2019t take it personally, but use it as feedback and fuel to improve on.<\/p>\n<p>One final piece of advice for founders looking to fundraise is to do your due diligence almost as well as the VC does DD on you. Too many founders rush in too quickly without realizing that this will be the person and the team that I\u2019ll end up working with, potentially for the next decade or so.
