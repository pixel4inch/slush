The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/themainframe.com\/\">Mainframe Industries<\/a>\u00a0team had previously announced completing a seed funding round worth \u20ac2 million led by Maki.vc, Play Ventures, Crowberry Capital, and Sisu Game Ventures, all of whom also participated in the latest Series A round.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The gaming studio is currently working on an open-world, social sandbox MMO specifically designed for cloud gaming, with cross-platform play across multiple devices. In English, a game that you can play from anywhere, in any way and whenever you please.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To understand the ins and outs of their path from an idea to a whopping 13 people founder team, divided between Helsinki and Reykjavik, and a\u00a0<b>\u20ac7.6\u00a0<\/b>million Series A investment in the pocket by one of the most prestigious investment companies in the world, we sat down for an interview with Thor Gunnarsson, the CEO, and Co-founder of Mainframe Industries.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Expect to learn:&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<ul>\n<li>How did Mainframe Industries approach their fundraising process?<\/li>\n<li>What do Iceland and Finland have in common when it comes to culture?<\/li>\n<li>How does it feel to be the CEO?<\/li>\n<li>What is the biggest mistake you\u2019ve done as a CEO?<\/li>\n<li>What are Thor\u2019s top tips for every founder looking to fundraise?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Let\u2019s start with a more philosophical one \u2013 of all things, why are you building a game?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]I think games are a social connection unlike anything else and the future of networks. That has resonated with me deeply. Games are not only a place to spend your free time but also a place to meet your friends and new people. They are a way of connecting with others through any device at any point in time.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;What can you tell us about the game you\u2019re building?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Unfortunately not much yet, but what I can tell you is that the game we\u2019re building is the one game we\u2019ve all prepared for and wanted to build for our whole lives. Our mission from the beginning was to create a game that everyone, no matter their gender or age, could call their home, where they can spend time with friends.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;You\u2019ve now mentioned all genders and all ages \u2013 how do you see the idea of diversity affecting your game?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]We\u2019re trying to build a game that attracts people from all walks of life. While the gender balance in the industry is very unbalanced towards men, we don\u2019t see a reason why games should only be built for men. We also think that your chances as a gaming studio of reaching a wider audience are small if you don\u2019t have for example women building the games.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;You also have a surprisingly big founding team, 13 people altogether. How have you made it work remotely?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<p class=\"p1\">To build the game we wanted to build, we needed to find the right experience and the right \u201clike-minded\u201d developers with a passion similar to ours. We knew that we couldn\u2019t find the talent solely in Iceland and as we already knew people from the Helsinki-ecosystem, the airbridge was natural for us. Our cultures are incredibly similar \u2013 we both operate on the Nordic idea where \u201ctrust is given until it\u2019s broken\u201d.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On top of the<em>\u00a0trust by default<\/em>, the key to making the team work well together was to have several conversations about what we were planning to do and communicate, sometimes even over-communicate. With remote work, it\u2019s very easy to misunderstand others in written format. We also put a lot of effort into spending quality time with the team.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Mainframe Industries purposefully started with local VC\u2019s and after that started to look outside of Nordics for the A round. How did you approach the fundraising process?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]We had high ambitions for investors \u2013 after all, when you decide to sign the deal with an investor, you are virtually inviting them to join your team for the next several years. We approached the funding in two stages. When Mainframe was founded, we set out to find interesting local investors like Maki.vc, Play Ventures, and Sisu Game Ventures in Finland and Crowberry Capital out of Iceland, to build strong local pillars. I think it\u2019s vital for any startup to start with strong local support. It helps in the long run and gives you wider networks and validation in your backyard.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Mainframe Industries is the first Nordic startup to get funded by a16z. How did that happen?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<p class=\"p1\">I think anyone who follows the scene is familiar with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/\">a16z<\/a>. They were very high on our list from the start, because of their investment thesis on games and massive, 160 strong operational partnership. That operational know-how brings real value for us.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Last fall, we were introduced to Andrew Chen and Jon Lai from the fund, who have an especially deep understanding of the gaming space. Our initial plan was to meet them at Slush, but we found out that they were not able to come to Slush 2019 after all. For us though, the timing of the discussions was critical as we were seeing momentum after fund-raising kick-off coming out of Slush which is one of the most important things to have when fund-raising. We wanted to take advantage of it and so we booked our tickets to California right away.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;How can a founder charm the VC\u2019s on the other side of the table? What is the magic trick?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]The magic is in the conversation. You need to take the time to get to know each other. The discussion should not be just a one-way pitch \u2013 you\u2019re essentially asking them to join your company for years to come. After we sat down with Jon &amp; Andrew from a16z, we quickly understood through the in-depth discussions how well their investment thesis resonated with what we wanted to achieve at Mainframe Industries.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Thor\u2019s top tips for fundraising&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b>Do your homework.<\/b>\u00a0Reach out to companies and partners who have worked or invested in your field.

In our last round, Harri Manninen at Play Ventures introduced us to Riot while the a16z conversation started through a personal connection between Andrew Chen and my co-founder and Design Director Sulka Haro.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b>Finding the right investors and fundraising takes time and patience.<\/b>\u00a0No matter how fast you\u2019re trying to pull it off (and the conventional wisdom says 6 months to raise a round), it can easily take double that time.

They, of course, possess other qualities too, like delegating work and sharing power with their team, but communicating and listening come always first.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you Thor for sitting down with us!\u00a0<\/em>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_color=&#8221;#fafafa&#8221; full_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; sticky_row=&#8221;true&#8221; sticky_row_alignment=&#8221;top&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; class=&#8221;article&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221; shape_type=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; left_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; constrain_group_2=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_backdrop_filter=&#8221;none&#8221; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;static&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; column_padding_type=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_position=&#8221;default&#8221; row_position_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; row_position_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; pointer_events=&#8221;all&#8221;][vc_column_inner left_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; constrain_group_101=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; left_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_103=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; left_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_105=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/slush.org\/how-to-do-mistakes-as-a-ceo-qa-with-mainframe-industries-ceo-co-founder-thor-gunnarsson\/\">&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Read more about: How to Do Mistakes as a CEO &nbsp;&raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":2656,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[35,57],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2610"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2610"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2610\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3157,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2610\/revisions\/3157"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2656"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2610"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2610"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2610"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
