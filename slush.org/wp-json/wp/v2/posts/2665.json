While a lot of the recent interest in corporate-startup collaboration has been focused on investments and acquisitions, there are other important ways in which corporates and startups can be useful to each other. For example, corporate partners are often enlisted when startups need help in expanding to new markets and working on their product.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we will take a closer look at what the data has to say about the inner workings of startup-corporate entanglements. While we discuss investments extensively, we\u2019ve also looked at corporate-startup collaboration in a more comprehensive manner. There are some interesting dynamics at play; expect to learn about who\u2019s particularly dependent on corporate cooperation, at what stage corporates are likely to invest, and how corporate investors fare in terms of gender diversity metrics, among other things.

As one could expect, CVCs are better placed to judge the technical risk involved in hardware bets (at least when investing within the domain of their parent company), as well as more able to accept the long time horizon involved. After all, most corporate investors don\u2019t face the pressure of external Limited Partners (LPs), or even a fund structure at all.<\/p>\n<p>This all, in turn, is appealing to startups. As a result of it all, 25% of hardware startups\u2019 investor meetings at Slush 2019 were with a corporate investor, compared to 16% of those that software startups took.

Only 47% of corporate investors reported that their deal flow needs to be directly connected to their parent company\u2019s business or product.

This is reflected in the profiles of startup employees that they meet with. At Slush 2019, 61% of meetings between corporate investors and startups were with a non-founding employee, compared to 53% of VC meetings.

Looking at the revenue that investors expect as a share of the tickets they write shows that, while corporates are valuing companies more conservatively at the pre-seed and seed stage, they become significantly more generous than VCs beyond Series A.
