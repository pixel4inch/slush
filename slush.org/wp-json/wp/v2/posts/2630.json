Develop your storytelling \u2013 your most powerful asset&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]A key leadership attribute is an exceptional ability to tell a story. Sonali explains, \u201cStorytelling impacts every aspect: founders need to sell their vision to attract customers, to attract great talent, and to raise capital.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It starts with the unique insight that led a founder to start their business, often a trademark \u2018aha moment\u2019; as they\u2019ve joined certain dots or spotted a white space that others don\u2019t notice. \u201cIt could be noticing a weakness in a competitor\u2019s product or a customer need you have experienced by being really deep in an industry,\u201d Sonali says.<\/p>\n<p>But vision alone is not enough, \u201cA founder needs to find that artful balance of selling their tomorrow but focusing on today. What\u2019s very powerful is when their vision can be distilled into clear decisions on what they need to do now to get there. When an entrepreneur can tell that story clearly, it\u2019s hard not to want to get onboard,\u201d she says.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;2. Hire the best out there&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Storytelling along with vision, passion and charisma play a key role in attracting talent. A great leader has the ability to attract the kind of talent that, on the face of it, might feel impossible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t hire the best you can see, hire the best you can possibly get,\u201d Sonali says. Describing an iconic example from Accel\u2019s portfolio: \u201cIt was a seminal moment when Sheryl Sandberg decided to join Facebook in 2008,\u201d she shares. \u201cSheryl, of course, had multiple big roles she could have accepted instead, including being the CEO of a company. But because of Facebook\u2019s ambition and the impact she knew she could have, she took the job of COO.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sonali believes the most successful founders can convince someone who was already set on becoming their own boss to work for them. \u201cIf you look at the C-Suites of the best startups, you\u2019ll see a number of people that could have easily headed up their own companies. However, they chose to join a company within someone else\u2019s founding story because the mission is so compelling.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;3. Expect some hires to fail&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]However, not every hire turns out to be right. As companies raise money faster than ever, they are also hiring at an unforeseen pace.<\/p>\n<p>Leaders should embrace the inevitability that not everything will go as planned. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the journey that you get some hires right and others you don\u2019t. Hiring is a muscle that takes a lot of training to get fit. With the people who don\u2019t work out, take care of them and help them land another job,\u201d Sonali says. \u201cNot moving fast enough to let someone go can breed ill will and complacency within a team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>People&#8217;s success is often correlated with a strong HR function, which wasn\u2019t something the startup scene talked about when Sonali was starting at Accel in 2008. This has changed over the past 5 years, and entrepreneurs who invested in great HR teams early on are seeing it pay back multiple times over.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, hiring a great people officer and strong recruiters before you actually need them can be a huge advantage. \u201cTo build a great recruiting funnel, the hiring team will need to know your culture. Give them that time and help them get to know what good looks like for your company,\u201d Sonali says.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;4. Clarify and prioritise ruthlessly&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]In a period of rapid growth, clarity of thought, or the ability to focus on the right decisions in uncertainty, becomes incredibly important.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe invest in early-stage companies who are true innovators, which often means there is a big vision but little proof. How the founders think and make decisions determines how they execute. Good execution is often the result of a series of good decisions and prioritizations,\u201d Sonali explains.<\/p>\n<p>Clarity of thought is something that can be developed. One way is to surround yourself with people who ask the right questions. Sonali suggests, \u201cAn entrepreneur should use their board for this. Board meetings should not be update sessions. Send your board the key questions and priorities in advance so they can come prepared and you can have a robust debate on the issues that actually move the needle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lean on other advisors and mentors for this, too. However, it\u2019s always preferable to take feedback from those who are following your journey rather than dipping in and out. Especially those with skin in the game, whether that means money or reputation.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;5. Balancing values and value&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Rapid growth often leads entrepreneurs to decision-making moments where they\u2019ll face a tradeoff between values and value. Sonali has seen that the strongest companies have found a way to manage those conflicts. \u201cDon\u2019t forego your core values, as you focus on building shareholder value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some of the most important values she\u2019s currently seeing are transparency, diversity, and inclusiveness.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, Nordic founders seem to excel at these, such as Ilkka Paananen and Mikko Kodisoja of the Finnish gaming company Supercell. Accel led Supercell\u2019s Series A in 2011 and saw how the business embodies the Finnish attitude that everyone is more or less equal from the first time they meet. For example, while it\u2019s typically just the founders that meet with VCs, Ilkka, and Mikko brought their entire team to the meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Staying true to their values comes naturally to the younger generation of founders. \u201cWhat I find common in many millennial leaders is that they want to win but also do the right thing. It is the nature of today\u2019s workplace, where for employees to engage, buying into the mission is critical. I have seen time and time again when things go awry, it is the employees first and foremost who demand that their leaders walk the walk,\u201d Sonali says.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;6. Be transparent in order to build trust&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Transparency is worthy of a tip of its own, as it\u2019s key to empowering your executives to the best of your abilities, so they can truly step up. At its core, transparency means being accessible, authentic, and open to feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Founder of mobile consumer bank\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/monzo.com\/\">Monzo<\/a>, Tom Blomfield, is a great example, \u201cHis transparency has taken me aback at times,\u201d Sonali says.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a CEO typically announces a new investment to their team after the deal is signed and set in stone. When Accel decided to invest in Monzo, Blomfield announced the news to his entire 300-strong team before it was signed. \u201cI remember thinking: is this a good idea? But complete transparency and accountability is Tom\u2019s philosophy as a leader,\u201d Sonali says.<\/p>\n<p>This attitude extends to an all-hands Q&amp;A session every week where Tom answers questions submitted in advance. Following the investment announcement, one question was: Why do you think you should still continue as CEO as the company continues to scale meaningfully? \u201cAnd he answered in a completely open, authentic way,\u201d Sonali says.\u00a0<em>(Editor\u2019s note: In May 2020,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/20\/monzo-co-founder-tom-blomfield-moves-from-uk-ceo-role-to-president\/\">Monzo announced<\/a>\u00a0that after five years, Tom Blomfield will be stepping down as CEO and continuing as President.)<\/em>[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;7. Build a well-functioning executive team&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Transparency also plays a key role in how CEOs build relationships with their executive team. The best CEOs Sonali has worked with understand that they need to build relationships with their key executives as a leadership group and not just individually.<\/p>\n<p>Often, first-time CEOs nail their one-on-ones, but they don\u2019t naturally embrace doing the same with all their key execs in the same room.<\/p>\n<p>Moving from being a founder or small founding team to a bigger company without effectively cultivating this way of working can become difficult for a company over time, as it becomes too much about the CEO, Sonali notes. She compares a well-working company to the human body: the organs need to be talking with each other for the whole entity to work properly.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure this happens, CEOs should bring their execs together in weekly meetings. \u201cThat\u2019s when the magic happens \u2013 when smart people with the right incentives, who\u2019ve all got skin in the game, come together to build on each other. You\u2019ll get more than from just one-on-ones,\u201d she says.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;8. Keep focused on the North Star&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]It is so easy to be blinded by shiny new things, especially when your company starts to grow, and numerous options are thrown at you. \u201cInherently, founders like new opportunities and new ideas. That\u2019s their natural instinct, but some of the best founders I\u2019ve worked with have a great ability to selectively mute it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A founder that builds the right dialogue with the team, customers, board, and shareholders is more likely to stay true to their mission. Figuring out what you won\u2019t do is equally important to figure out what you will do, Sonali says. \u201cAs the founder of a young startup, one of your most important assets is your focus,\u201d she adds.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes entrepreneurs tend to take their sight off their original vision and obsess over competitors\u2019 narratives. \u201cSuddenly, they may find themselves playing a defensive game, going to markets or launching products to compete against what others are doing rather than following their own voice.\u201d This isn\u2019t how you win. \u201cYou win by playing your own game, and playing it incredibly well,\u201d Sonali concludes.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221;
