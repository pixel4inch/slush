Creandum was very supportive in terms of connecting us to these angel investors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Filling the round is standard at Creandum rounds, according to Simon. The logic lies in the added human capital these experienced entrepreneurs bring to the table.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur belief is that there are people significantly better suited to answer Bence\u2019s questions. I\u2019m not a data warehouse engineer, so if Bence has a question about data warehouses, it\u2019s my job to make sure that he meets someone who can answer that question, not answer that question myself.

As Simon notes, in today\u2019s funding climate having P\/M fit is no longer the case for many Series A\u2019s, but raising with team, vision, and a plan is possible.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet me ask: what is a Series A? There is no set definition of a Series A and now we see 30 million seed rounds \u2013 not valuation but ticket size. It used to just be that investments in the range from 8 to 15 million euros were called Series A rounds, but we can now see companies raise a round that they call an A round, and then two years later they add another 50 million and call it an A round extension.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Those historical proof points aren\u2019t as pivotal as they used to be for raising larger pockets of money; especially if you have previous merits working in your favor.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow we often see really strong serial founders raising 2, 3, or 4 million euro pre-seed rounds on a deck. Then the next round is a 20 million euro A round \u2013 the seed round got deleted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Other reasons for the change in Series A according to Simon and Bence are the increasing costs with human and other resources, as well as investors\u2019 hunger.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Bence:<strong>\u00a0\u201c<\/strong>From a startup\u2019s perspective, investors also seem to be hungrier, which plays into multiple other factors. The time to decide is shorter, because investors are not as conservative as they used to be in 2017 when we started out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>But the changing nature of funding is also a consequence of the advancement of the European ecosystem \u2013 there are simply better ideas and founders to invest in.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Simon: \u201cEntrepreneurship in Europe has finally reached a level where the entrepreneurs understand\u00a0 that they can build category-defining global software businesses. The entrepreneurs today aim higher, go bigger, and sell more globally. The number of multi-billion dollar companies is so high that it is financially justified for us to invest more money, because the outcomes have gotten bigger.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>For Simon, the SEON founders are a prime manifestation of this phenomenon.\u00a0<\/em>\u201cLook at Bence and Tommy in their mid-20s leading hundreds of people, serving global customers, selling hundreds of thousands of contract values, building a new category product that is being bought by 100-year-old institutions, making\u00a0<em>their<\/em>\u00a0product better.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;LIFE AFTER SERIES A&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]\n<h4><strong>From Promise to Metrics<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><em>Before Series A founders\u2019 focus \u2013 quite naturally \u2013 tends to be on not only nailing P\/M fit, but also building tenable structures and frameworks to ensure future growth.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cBefore Series A, we were locked into scaling up our team and building out the relevant frameworks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>So, what happens after Series A? Series A is sometimes viewed as the critical facilitating step between\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ycombinator.com\/library\/3Q-when-to-raise-a-series-a\"><em>promise and metrics<\/em><\/a><em>, Seed-stage and Series B. Bence wholeheartedly agrees that now is the time to focus on attribution and measuring everything down to the penny.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that the things that we\u2019re doing are working, but we really want to attribute everything in terms of return on investment. Our Revenue Operations Manager Guy Longton is working closely with the sales and marketing team on digging out every last metric in order for us to be able to attribute our spending and our customer cohorts, so that we can better distribute our resources over the long term.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Another crucial step following Series A is the transition from a founding team to a management team, where decisions are no longer based on founders\u2019 gut feeling but data. This means adjusting from being thoroughly hands-on in every aspect of the company to building middle-management the founders can trust to implement at the same level.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Simon: \u201cEvery company between the A and B stages has to build processes where significantly more money can lead to significantly more growth. What if we go from three salespeople to 30? How do we get to 30 salespeople? How do we train, integrate, and measure the people? Training three is easy, training 30 is different; that requires you to build a layer of people which are no longer founder-driven. It requires the founders to step away from knowing every detail and doing everything themselves to hiring people who they can trust to be better than them in their respective fields.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Investors as Influencers<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><em>Well then, what is the role of investors in all of this? For Simon it\u2019s all about planting seeds but letting the founders tend to their own garden as they see best fit.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do things for SEON, but I can ask questions and highlight where we see other companies in our portfolio who are doing really well or even better. It might apply to you or not, but you should look into different options. The fact that you have thought about it will automatically give you a higher likelihood of success as you\u2019ve taken all factors into consideration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Best practices on fundamentals like decision-making, quality of talent, and critical operational structures can lay out a foundation, but they can\u2019t dictate any individual company\u2019s blueprint for success.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cJust because Klarna did something similar six years ago in a different market with a different product doesn\u2019t mean that SEON needs to do it the same way to succeed. The more I can connect Bence and Tommy and the rest with people who have also set up successful businesses, the more they get inspired. My job is more of an influencer rather than an executive.\u201d<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>The Partner who invests usually sits on the board of the startup, but beyond that the role that VCs play and how actively they play it may vary from fund to fund, with platform VCs being at the most active end of the spectrum. While Simon can see the advantage in this approach, Creandum has a more hands-off style.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have people like a Head of Talent, and people in marketing. However, we do not believe that investors can build better products or run companies better than the entrepreneurs \u2013 if this is the case then they\u2019re investing in the wrong folks. We believe that the best Head of Design that I can get in front of Bence doesn\u2019t want to work for an investor, but for a product company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>From Founder to Manager<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><em>The transition taking place with Series A also comes with a set of challenges at the level of the founder. With the transition from founder to CEO, and founder to manager, the founder by definition has less control, and starts working on a different set of problems. The main thing on Bence\u2019s mind is growing as a leader.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have to actively think about how I can become a better leader over the long term, and what type of leader I want to become.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>And the game changes when you transition from 15 people working in a room together to 140 people, prompting bittersweet emotions similar to seeing your kid grow up.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was very much like a family back then, now it\u2019s changed. It\u2019s almost as if you see a kid a year later, and they\u2019ve grown a lot, but for the kid or their parents it\u2019s been totally natural. It\u2019s very similar to founders \u2013 we don\u2019t realize how much we\u2019ve grown until it\u2019s already happened, since we\u2019re in it on a daily basis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Bence\u2019s focus on developing as a leader is music to Simon\u2019s ears.\u00a0<\/em><strong>\u201c<\/strong>The transition from founder to CEO, founder to manager, is a very challenging one. There are many examples of people who struggle with that. If you actively work with that question, there\u2019s a significantly higher chance for success.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_color=&#8221;#fafafa&#8221; full_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; sticky_row=&#8221;true&#8221; sticky_row_alignment=&#8221;top&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; class=&#8221;article&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221; shape_type=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; left_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; constrain_group_2=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_backdrop_filter=&#8221;none&#8221; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;static&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; column_padding_type=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_position=&#8221;default&#8221; row_position_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; row_position_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; pointer_events=&#8221;all&#8221;][vc_column_inner left_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; constrain_group_101=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; left_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_103=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; left_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_105=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/slush.org\/how-to-raise-a-series-a-a-story-by-creandum-and-seon\/\">&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Read more about: How to Raise a Series A: A Story by Creandum and Seon &nbsp;&raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":2758,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[35,51],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2757"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2757"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2757\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3101,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2757\/revisions\/3101"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2758"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2757"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2757"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2757"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
