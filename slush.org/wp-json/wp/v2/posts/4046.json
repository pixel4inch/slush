The first version of <a href=\"https:\/\/node.slush.org\">Node<\/a> was launched in the Fall of 2020. We wanted to explore more accessible ways for founders to meet investors and get in touch with those who have done it before. From the start, we steered away from boring webinars and built every concept interactive. That\u2019s why we built Node with a clear vision: to become the go-to platform for relevant first investor-founder touchpoints.<\/p>\n<p>Since Node\u2019s inception, we\u2019ve hosted 25+ virtual matchmaking sprints between founders and investors, averaging over 50 meetings per sprint. From every one of those 15min 1-on-1 meetings sprints, there has been reported follow-up meetings. This is how we scale the investor touchpoint for founders.<\/p>\n<p>We have hosted 200+ sessions with the top founders and investors. Through Node by Slush, startup founders have forged meaningful connections with leading founders, operators, and investors from Europe and beyond. Slush is on a mission to help and create the founders to change the world. To support you year-round: we are building Node by Slush.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;WHAT IS NEW?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]We\u2019re excited to announce that the year-round Node community is now seamlessly integrated into the Slush Platform.
