Ahead of Pitch\u2019s last funding round, this meant aligning around our product vision. This was an essential first step as we prepared to speak with investors.<\/p>\n<p>The fundraising process is an opportunity to separate yourself from day-to-day operations, reflect on the way you want to change the world, and consider your game plan and your progress toward doing so.<\/p>\n<p>At Pitch, we engaged our product team with a kick-off workshop to sketch the high-level story we wanted to tell. At the Series B stage, we had already launched publicly, we were clear on our roadmap, and we were getting regular feedback from users on the value our product was delivering. But we didn\u2019t want our pitch to be defined (or limited) by where we were at that time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Carlo:\u00a0<\/b>Assuming you have a product or an idea and a team in place then make sure you can explain it to a stranger in under 30 seconds: What are you making, and why should anyone care about (and pay for) it?<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#2 Crafting a story&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<b>Christian<\/b>:\u00a0The most important lesson I\u2019ve learned in all my years of pitching is to take enough time to plan and craft your story before committing content to slides.<\/p>\n<p>As a founder, your vision is already crystal-clear in your own head. Too many founders think their first step is to turn that into a slick set of slides and then start shopping around. This is a trap, and it\u2019s important to resist the urge to jump straight in.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, you should view fundraising as an opportunity to step back, talk to your personal network, and gain new inspiration and perspective. Invest the time early on to reconnect your mission to the world around you. It\u2019s the best way to get ready to frame your company as a venture-scale opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Jasmine<\/b>:\u00a0No one that you will present to knows your company or product better than you, so find confidence in knowing that you are the expert here!

I\u2019ve witnessed many talented, driven founders fail to delegate effectively to co-founders, teammates, and advisors \u2014 or worse, fail to involve them at all. If you hold onto the deck too tightly, or share it with others too late in the process, your pitch will inevitably be worse.<\/p>\n<p>Pitching a truly great idea is bigger than any one person. Think of your job like directing a movie, a play, or a concert: you can\u2019t play every role yourself, but you can set the bar for quality, and create the conditions to put on a great performance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Carlo<\/b>:\u00a0Everything was \u2014 and still is \u2014 about teamwork. We first iterated and sketched out what exactly<i>\u00a0<\/i>we wanted to get across with post-its and whiteboards; changing a post-it or a whiteboard note is fast and free, re-designing a slide deck is slow and expensive.

(That\u2019s what Pitch is for, so trust me on this one.)<\/p>\n<p>Preparing a deck doesn\u2019t need to happen sequentially, or in isolation. Think of it as a living, breathing story that will change, evolve, and grow along with your own understanding of the value of your product. Be ready to switch things around, ditch slides altogether, and even restart from scratch. It\u2019s part of the process.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s plenty of advice and best practices out there on slide design but the good news is that these days, you don\u2019t have to be a designer (or hire one) to make a beautiful pitch deck.

They\u2019ll want to have your pitch deck in advance as a pre-read, so you\u2019re likely not going to get to deliver every slide. Think about adding a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pitch.com\/blog\/introducing-recordings\">recording<\/a>\u00a0so they get the chance to hear your pitch in full, and when you meet with them, you can focus on the most important feedback, take questions, and talk next steps.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Jasmine<\/b>:\u00a0I never in a million years thought we would win Slush 100, which meant I hadn\u2019t even prepared the longer pitch that was needed for the finals \u2013 so I was scrambling a little between the two pitches! If I could do it again, I would have prepared both versions of my pitch so they were both ready if I were to qualify for the final. I would also build them in such a way that your entire script doesn\u2019t change.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Carlo<\/b>:\u00a0I recommend studying templates,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pitch.com\/presentations\">slide decks<\/a>, and books to fill in the blanks (e.g. how much money you need for which milestones).

A broad range of feedback from people in different disciplines (especially those outside your own industry bubble) is the key to building a well-rounded presentation with a simple, powerful, and memorable message.<\/p>\n<p>Note down all the questions you get, especially those that come up multiple times.

It\u2019s one thing to know how to tell your story, but another to know how to manage the interaction. Give a very short intro that always works, and ask your audience how they\u2019d like to spend their time with you. This will give you confidence that you\u2019re spending it wisely.<\/p>\n<p>Also, remember that the time you\u2019ve been given is limited and precious. Like editors that have limited space in a newspaper, or producers that only have so many minutes in a TV show, you need to focus on the points that matter, not the whole story. Remember, it\u2019s OK (and, in some cases, good) to leave things to follow up on.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, remember that you\u2019re seeking a collaboration, not just a signed check.

When your pitch deck\u2019s up on the screen, the stage is set for you to deliver your story.
