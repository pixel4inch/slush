For the European startup founders in our dataset, taking companies public is more popular than being acquired, with a slight overall majority of 52.9%. Getting acquired by another company is a strong second with 43.3%, whereas acquisition by an institutional investor isn\u2019t a popular alternative, with only 3.9% of founders preferring this option.<\/p>\n<p>To some extent taking companies public may be more popular due to them being more financially lucrative. This is evident when looking at Dealroom data on the valuations of European VC-backed exits in general, and then comparing them with the sub-cohort of IPOs during 2015-2021*: average valuations of exits in this period were on average \u20ac173.6M, the corresponding figure being 699.2M for IPOs. As visible in the graph below, the difference in valuation between European exits and IPOs has become increasingly pronounced from 2017 onwards, and exploded in the first months of 2021 with major IPOs like those of UiPath and Deliveroo.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2713&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]European founders\u2019 keenness to go public is stronger than the actual proportion of companies that exit through this method; Dealroom data shows that whereas there were 2,545 exits of VC-backed companies in Europe in 2015-2021, only 10.0% (251) of these were through IPOs (the dataset excluding SPACs, of which there has been\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/02\/12\/spac-frenzy-blank-check-firms-eye-deals-in-europes-tech-sector.htm\">a negligent amount to date<\/a>\u00a0in Europe).

While there has been much talk of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/04\/29\/how-much-revenue-does-it-take-to-be-a-1b-public-company\/\">100M revenue threshold<\/a>\u00a0in the past, other considerations such as growth prospects, competitive landscape, and the predictability of revenue flow and the business itself, weigh in on the equation.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2722&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]It is hardly surprising that when it comes to\u00a0<i>valuation<\/i>, the greatest concentration in the data (19.5%) is around the \u20ac1B mark of unicorn status that has become a strong informal metric of success within the global startup ecosystem. Nevertheless, the data is still relatively broadly distributed starting from the lowest valuation category of &lt;\u20ac50M which has the second highest proportion (13.8%), possibly reflecting the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/2020.stateofeuropeantech.com\/chapter\/value-creation\/article\/tech-ipos\/\">higher variety<\/a>\u00a0of IPO profiles in Europe.[\/vc_column_text][image_with_animation image_url=&#8221;2723&#8243; image_size=&#8221;full&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;entrance&#8221; animation=&#8221;None&#8221; animation_movement_type=&#8221;transform_y&#8221; hover_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; alignment=&#8221;&#8221; border_radius=&#8221;20px&#8221; box_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; image_loading=&#8221;default&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width_mobile=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_column_text]When compared with Dealroom data on actual IPO valuations, we can see that European founders have a quite accurate understanding of the general valuation levels at which companies IPO in Europe. The median in our data, \u20ac500M-1B, is around the average valuation at which European companies have IPO\u2019d according to Dealroom data, \u20ac699.2M.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>* Here 2021 data refers to data from Dealroom up to the end of April 2021.<\/i>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_color=&#8221;#fafafa&#8221; full_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; sticky_row=&#8221;true&#8221; sticky_row_alignment=&#8221;top&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; class=&#8221;article&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221; shape_type=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; left_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; constrain_group_2=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_backdrop_filter=&#8221;none&#8221; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;static&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; column_padding_type=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_position=&#8221;default&#8221; row_position_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; row_position_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; pointer_events=&#8221;all&#8221;][vc_column_inner left_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; constrain_group_101=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; left_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_103=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; left_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_105=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/slush.org\/what-european-founders-think-about-going-public\/\">&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Read more about: What European Founders Think About Going Public &nbsp;&raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":2711,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[35,60,56],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2710"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2710"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2710\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3119,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2710\/revisions\/3119"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2711"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2710"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2710"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2710"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
