While Calm is now used by millions of people around the globe, the journey has been anything but linear.

The promising journey that began in 2007 quickly turned into one infused with increasing stress and anxiety, ultimately leading to a burnout.<\/p>\n<p>This is when Michael\u2019s good friend, and future Co-founder, Alex Tew started talking to Michael about meditation and mindfulness. What followed was an escape to the mountains of Austria.\u00a0<i>\u201cI went away on my own to rebalance myself and become healthy again,\u201d<\/i>\u00a0Michael recalls:\u00a0<i>\u201cI started to meditate.\u201d\u00a0<\/i>Inspired by the effect of the newly found routine on his own mental health, Michael went on to read books and research papers on meditation and mindfulness. He diagnosed meditation as an effective way of rewiring the human brain, quickly realizing that it was an\u00a0<i>\u201cincredibly valuable skill\u201d<\/i>\u00a0that had been around for thousands of years, yet had not been brought to the mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What would happen if one made meditation accessible, relatable, and simple?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Returning back from his retreat, Michael was ready to start building again. He had found the problem he wanted to solve\u00a0 \u2013 contagious stress which kept spreading over the globe. He had also found his solution: meditation and mindfulness. The end result was Calm, which Michael founded with Alex in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, it had been the \u201cweird and wonderful world of pet monsters\u201d that had opened the doors for a dreadful behemoth to lurk its way into Michael\u2019s life. Yet as a consequence, there was no longer any question on the importance of meditation and mindfulness. Calm was Michael\u2019s way of bringing his realization to life on a world-wide scale. What has Michael learned on the way?[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Growth Trajectories, Inflection Points, and the Multiple Founding Moments Along the Way&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]The journey from the founding of Calm to the present day has been nothing short of strenuous, mainly due to the widespread suspicion towards meditation during the company\u2019s early days. Attracting investors on board and building a solid customer base took time. Yet despite the difficulties, Calm has managed to scale.<\/p>\n<p>When asked, Michael outlines three inflection points in the early days of Calm that were pivotal to its growth. First has to do with pricing, the second with customer retention, and the third with the size of the market.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#1: Raise Your Prices<a id=\"calmprice\"><\/a><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Calm is a subscription based app. At the very beginning, users were charged 10 dollars a year to unlock all meditation content available. The business was growing steadily, but revenue streams remained modest. Something drastic had to be done to increase revenue, as the company was struggling to raise funding.<\/p>\n<p>The team decided to increase the prices. They quadrupled the yearly price to 40 dollars, expecting to see a radical drop off in users. None was detected.\u00a0<i>\u201cRaise your prices\u201d<\/i>, Michael advises,\u00a0<i>\u201cif you\u2019re building something great, don\u2019t be afraid to charge for it.\u201d<\/i>\u00a0During the early days, even a slight increase in price can make a massive difference.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#2: Help People Build A Habit<a id=\"calmhabit\"><\/a><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>While raising your prices can prove to be highly beneficial during the early days, it alone does little in the long run if the product does not remain stimulating. Helping people build a habit around your product can be a powerful driving force behind customer retention. At least in Calm\u2019s case it was. One of its more popular products is something called the Daily Calm \u2013 a guided 10 minutes long meditation that is new every day.\u00a0<i>\u201cA new lesson, a new quote, a new motivation\u201d<\/i>\u00a0Michael lists,\u00a0<i>\u201cthat helps people build a habit and come back every day.\u201d\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#3: Go After Big Markets<a id=\"calmmarket\"><\/a><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>While Calm started as a pure meditation app, it quickly became an app for meditation\u00a0<i>and<\/i>\u00a0sleep. Currently, Calm\u2019s Sleep Stories are arguably its most popular product offering. Rather than having a story arc, Sleep stories have a so-called\u00a0<i>story slope<\/i>. They start interesting, gradually turning more monotonous and bland, until finally the listener drifts to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Calm\u2019s move into content was partly data driven and partly intuitive \u2013 it emerged at an intersection of two opposite ways of operating that is often the breeding ground for the best ideas out there, at least according to Michael. On the one hand, everyone wants to sleep better, and many people in Michael\u2019s close circle of friends were suffering from insomnia. On the other hand, Calm\u2019s own data suggested that people were using its meditation content not to meditate but to fall asleep: they experienced a spike in users every evening around 11 pm. Taken together, the result was sleep stories.<\/p>\n<p>What was the learning here?\u00a0<i>\u201cGo after big markets,\u201d<\/i>\u00a0Michael says,\u00a0<i>\u201cmeditation is great and a very important part of Calm, but every single human being on earth goes to sleep every single night.\u201d<\/i>\u00a0That is 7.9 billion people.\u00a0<i>\u201cIt\u2019s a big market to play in,\u201d\u00a0<\/i>Michael laughs,<i>\u00a0\u201cit is hard to go beyond, unless we go to Mars.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the lessons derived from these inflection points, Michael offers a fourth piece of advice for founders.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><b>#4: Roll the dice as often as you can<a id=\"calmdice\"><\/a><\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Calm may stand out in the world of startups due to its strong mental health and wellbeing oriented ethos, yet its hockey stick growth trajectory resembles the typical startup experience.\u00a0<i>\u201cIt is lots of little things that in time compound, and suddenly, it tips and you\u2019re winning App of the Year,\u201d\u00a0<\/i>Michael says:\u00a0<i>\u201cyou\u2019ve got to do all of those little things, hiring the right people, getting the right brand, building the most amazing product, and every day, showing up to work and making it 1% better.\u201d\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>What every founder should remember is that there are different ways of getting on top of the same mountain, is Michael\u2019s final suggestion.<i>\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make every decision correct,\u201d<\/i>\u00a0he says,\u00a0<i>\u201cbut you need to move fast.\u201d\u00a0<\/i>As an entrepreneur,\u00a0<i>\u201cyou\u2019re rolling the dice as often as you can,\u201d<\/i>\u00a0Michael says,\u00a0<i>\u201cyou\u2019re trying lots of different things, very quickly, to see what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d<\/i>\u00a0When something seems to be working, you do more of it.

Not only does it force people to stop for a moment, when practiced together as a team, it also helps bring people closer together.<\/p>\n<p>Calm gives its employees multiple mental health days off during the year.\u00a0<i>\u201cJust a few weeks ago, we gave our first ever mental health week off to the entire company,\u201d<\/i>\u00a0Michael reveals.\u00a0<i>\u201cThe beauty about the whole company taking a week off together is that you don\u2019t have to feel guilty\u201d<\/i>\u00a0he says,\u00a0<i>\u201cthere\u2019s no zoom calls you\u2019re missing, no passive-aggressive Slack messages.\u201d<\/i>\u00a0According to him,\u00a0<i>\u201cit was one of the best things we\u2019ve done as a company.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Not only has the focus on mindfulness shaped Calm as a company through company-wide practices, it has done so through increasingly mindful leadership.\u00a0<i>\u201cWe work so hard optimizing our business, looking at every single metric,\u201d<\/i>\u00a0Michael says of the founders.\u00a0<i>\u201cWhat if the most important piece of the puzzle is ourselves,\u201d he asks, \u201cif we\u2019re not in a mentally strong place, how do we expect our teams to be?\u201d\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Calm is being built on a foundation of mental fortitude, but where will it go next? On stage, Michael flagged out a set of possible future scenarios for Calm:<i>\u00a0\u201cCould we have a hospitality arm? Could there be retail products? Could there be a magazine?\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are left waiting for what Calm\u2019s next steps will be.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]\n<h4><strong>World\u2019s Happiest App: The Founding Story of Calm<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h5><strong>Michael Acton Smith (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.calm.com\/\">Calm<\/a>) &amp;
