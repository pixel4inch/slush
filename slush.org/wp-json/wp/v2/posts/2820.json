My marching orders were to find Melio\u2019s first customers \u2013 small businesses that were willing to share their invoices and allow us to make payments for them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Finding Melio\u2019s first 10 customers was a tall order. We had no product, no brand, and no big incentive to offer. What\u2019s more, we were asking small businesses to trust us to keep track of their vendor payments and access their funds to make the payments \u2013 a hard sell given that one late payment could jeopardize a small business\u2019s relationship with their vendor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When searching for Melio\u2019s first customers, I mostly leaned on my personal network. I asked friends and family if they knew a small business owner that would be interested in free bookkeeping services, advertised our services on Facebook groups, and even spent a few days knocking on doors in the streets of New York.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, we found a few small businesses willing to place their trust in an unknown startup. These businesses began sending me their invoices on WhatsApp and I would write checks to their vendors on their behalf. I would then feed these invoices to our designer and two engineers, who studied the invoices and began developing Melio\u2019s accounts payable solution.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These early customers gave us a behind-the-scenes look into how small businesses traditionally make payments \u2013 and their top pain points. We learned that small business payments are very decentralized \u2013 every business has its own system for keeping track of payments and businesses often pay each vendor in a different way. Most importantly, we quickly understood that there was a demand for an accounts payable and receivable tool to help small business owners spend less time in the back office and more time growing their business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A startup\u2019s first set of customers can provide valuable insights into the direction of your product. During the pre-product phase, listening to your customers and learning how you can help them is much more valuable than focusing on your next 100 or 1,000 customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Today, I am still grateful for the experience of recruiting Melio\u2019s first customers. Now, as I lead Melio\u2019s customer services and manage the New York site, I know I am much better equipped to provide Melio\u2019s customers with the best support possible.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Step 2: Finding your target audience&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<b>Inna Yuchvits:\u00a0<\/b>Once you have a better sense of what your product will be and what is the market demand, it is time to determine your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Startups often make the mistake of modeling their target audience based on prototypes and biases. And for a company like Melio that uniquely targets America\u2019s 32 million small businesses, these biases can be even harder to ignore.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In the United States,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/small-business\/articles\/small-business-statistics\/\">99.9% of all businesses<\/a>\u00a0are classified as small businesses, and these businesses employ nearly half of the U.S. workforce. In fact, it is hard to find someone that does not have a friend or family member who either works for or owns a small business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>During our early stages, we had to fight the urge to target what we know. For example, if I had a family member who worked at a restaurant, I might have strong opinions about whether restaurant owners should be one of our target audiences.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a general best practice, however, startups should try to ignore these biases when determining their target audiences for customer acquisition. Instead, they should model their audience based on behavior, not prototypes and clich\u00e9s.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rather than only targeting small business owners in certain verticals that pay a certain number of bills each month, we started modeling our target audience based on behavior. We knew that our products would be most helpful for customers that needed help managing their cash flow and wanted to spend less time in the back office.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By modeling our ideal customer\u2019s behavior rather than prototypes, we were able to shake off our preconceived ideas of what the ideal Melio customer looked like and could better determine how we should spend our marketing resources.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Step 3: Post-product customer acquisition phases \u2013 building your brand and growing your customer base&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<b>Inna Yuchvits:\u00a0<\/b>Once you have modeled your target audience, it is time to build your brand, create marketing campaigns, and invest more resources into acquiring customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At Melio, we first started by leveraging the existing demand. We used free methods, such as creating SEO-friendly website content, and paid methods, such as search engine advertisements, to attract small businesses searching for online payment tools.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, existing demand will run dry eventually. When that happens, it is time to pivot to reach customers that could benefit from your products \u2013 but they just don`t know it yet. This phase relies heavily on paid advertising to target customers that are not actively searching for your products.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>During this phase, it is critical to experiment with your messaging to determine what tactics are most effective. In stark contrast to other phases, your tactics can now be guided by quantitative rather than qualitative data.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An acronym we often repeat at Melio is ABT: Always Be Testing. Even today, while we continue to double down on effective messaging, we are also deploying new messaging to see if different framing and data points are resonating with small business owners.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;When to optimize&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Many startups invest in the top of the marketing funnel \u2013 education and awareness \u2013 too early or too late. Either a competitor beats them to it, or they start trying to attract customers before they know who they are.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My advice to other startups is simple: never optimize the top of the funnel. The cheapest leads or first-month users are not going to necessarily turn into the longest-running and highest-paying users. Rather, when it comes to optimizing your customer acquisition tactics, look to the bottom of the funnel. What is ultimately converting customers?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most expensive tactics to get potential customers to visit the sign-up page might also be the most effective. While cheaper customer acquisition tactics might look appealing, they may not deliver the results you were hoping for.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;How a strong customer acquisition strategy can create a better product and brand&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Melio would not be the company it is today without our first customers who helped us build a better product for the tens of thousands of customers that now use our platform. By developing strong professional relationships with these customers, we were able to receive the feedback we needed to develop a strong product.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Then, through trial and error, we built our brand. We found our niche in the B2B payments ecosystem and learned how to differentiate ourselves from competitors. Today, Melio is growing faster than ever, processing over $2 billion in payments monthly and helping our users cut in half the amount of time they spend on accounts payable while also better managing their cash flow.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our customer acquisition strategy essentially took the approach of trial and error, but we have no regrets about the decisions made during Melio\u2019s first year. Although some tactics were not as effective as others, we would not have found the best tactics without trying the worst tactics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to customer acquisition. Startups like ours have and will make mistakes \u2013 some more costly than others \u2013 but our willingness to adapt has been the key to our success.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>During the first year, customer acquisition is not just about acquiring the most number of customers that you can \u2013 it is about learning who your target audience is, their needs, and how your company fits into the bigger picture. If you can glean those insights during the first year, you won\u2019t just be able to acquire more customers, but you\u2019ll also be able to retain them for years to come.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;full_width_background&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_color=&#8221;#fafafa&#8221; full_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; sticky_row=&#8221;true&#8221; sticky_row_alignment=&#8221;top&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; class=&#8221;article&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221; shape_type=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; left_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; constrain_group_2=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_margin=&#8221;3vw&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_backdrop_filter=&#8221;none&#8221; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;static&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; animation_type=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221; column_padding_type=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_type=&#8221;default&#8221;][vc_row_inner column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_position=&#8221;default&#8221; row_position_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; row_position_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; pointer_events=&#8221;all&#8221;][vc_column_inner left_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; constrain_group_101=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_desktop=&#8221;10%&#8221; left_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_103=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_tablet=&#8221;2%&#8221; left_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; constrain_group_105=&#8221;yes&#8221; right_padding_phone=&#8221;2%&#8221; column_element_direction_desktop=&#8221;default&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; desktop_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/slush.org\/how-to-acquire-your-first-customers-a-b2b-guide-by-melio\/\">&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Read more about: How to Acquire Your First Customers: A B2B Guide by Melio &nbsp;&raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":2835,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[35,54],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2820"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2820"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2820\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3058,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2820\/revisions\/3058"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2835"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2820"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2820"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/slush.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2820"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
