It is this approach that has shaped his journey from teenage entrepreneur to co-founding and helming Paddle, a global delivery platform for SaaS businesses.\u00a0<\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paddle.com\/\"><i>Paddle<\/i><\/a><i>\u00a0integrates payments, checkout, subscription management, taxes, and compliance into one unified platform, enabling software businesses to scale without operational headaches.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Founded in 2012, the company now works with more than 3,000 software businesses across 245 countries and territories, securing $293m million in funding along the way. But how does a tech founder navigate the (inevitably) choppy waters from founding a startup to being the CEO of a 300-strong workforce? Christian shares some of the challenges and phases any tech founder will most likely pass through as their business evolves \u2013 and the four biggest lessons he\u2019s learned along the way.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>By 15, Christian had built his own invoicing software, turning over \u00a35 million in revenue within two years. After enlisting his peer Harrison Rose, the pair moved to London at age 18, to launch a new company \u2018Paddle.\u2019 At this stage, Christian\u2019s fascination with the mechanics of software had morphed into a fascination with the mechanics of business, and a desire to build the most effective organization possible.<\/i>[\/vc_column_text][nectar_single_testimonial testimonial_style=&#8221;small_modern&#8221; color=&#8221;Default&#8221; quote=&#8221;\u201cThe benefit of starting young is that you learn to go into a room with the mindset that you\u2019re the least qualified person\u201d&#8221;][vc_column_text]The idea behind Paddle originated from spending so much time on difficult operational challenges in our first business. And it was so frustrating because it wasn\u2019t the important stuff \u2013 it wasn\u2019t how do we build the best product, or how do we give our customers the best experience.<\/p>\n<p><i>Rather than wasting time fighting these things, Christian and Harrison went searching for a product that could solve these issues \u2013 only to find out nothing really existed.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>That was the genesis of Paddle: the idea that we could build something to take these pain points away from other businesses.[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Not all sunshine and rainbows (but many lessons)&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]We moved to London and met an angel investor. We didn\u2019t necessarily need his money but we needed his advice. So we said: \u2018Can we just come and sit in your office, and you point us in the direction of the right people \u2013 and we\u2019ll bribe them with chocolates or something?\u2019<\/p>\n<p>And from there on, there was a constant stream of things that failed miserably.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#1: Getting sued for a trademark&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]I remember our first piece of business post vividly. We were so excited by the idea we were a proper business. We felt like kings and did a dance, only to read that we were getting sued for using the name \u2018Paddle.\u2019 So that was the first thing we had to navigate as a company. Obviously, this was a pretty bad situation and we felt terrible. So we found a good lawyer and tried to have a conversation with the people suing us to resolve the situation. Which we did, very pragmatically.<\/p>\n<p><i><strong>Lesson:<\/strong>\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s\u00a0very easy in tough situations for your mind to immediately shift to imagining malice, or deem these things a personal indictment of the thing that you\u2019re building. At the end of the day, as cliche as it sounds, it\u2019s just business. You just have to approach these situations pragmatically and put yourself in the shoes of the other person. You then try to figure out what\u2019s the best course of action to, if possible, amicably resolve the situation.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#2: Failing pitches&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]After that, our first pitch \u2013 to one of the largest VC firms in London \u2013 was so abysmal that, apparently, they still laugh about it today. And the crux of it was that we didn\u2019t really know what we were doing. We had a hypothesis, but the product we were building at that time was a marketplace and the marketplace wasn\u2019t working, so we were getting lots of questions and didn\u2019t necessarily have good answers.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if we were too confident going in. It wasn\u2019t necessarily that I was unprepared, it was more that the business was unprepared for that conversation. We got the pitch opportunity after I was randomly introduced to the investors via another investor we knew. We were just invited in. But, in hindsight, I would have done nothing differently. I think the way things played out ultimately was better.<\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Lesson:<\/i>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Be very ready when you want to go out and ask people for their money, especially from people whose job it is to give you that money \u2013 as opposed to people who want to give you that money in spite of it not being their job.<\/p>\n<p>But my way of \u2018recovering\u2019 from the knockback was to think about it for 45 minutes and then completely move on. Building a business is a process of repeatedly getting punched in the face \u2013 and being insane or delusional enough to keep going, in spite of that. You have to recognize that nothing is ever as good or as bad as it seems and get back on the horse. No one gets any extra points for feeling sad about it, as callous as that may sound.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#3: Wrong business idea&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Even our initial business idea\u00a0for Paddle, we got entirely wrong. We got the hypothesis right: that people wanted a better way to sell software. But we got the execution wrong. We built a marketplace, rather than what we have now which is an infrastructure product.<\/p>\n<p>And we noticed this because no one was using it, nor were we making any money. But we initially reacted to this quite slowly. When you have an idea, and you believe in it, it\u2019s really easy to strongly believe that your idea is correct. But the ability to have strong beliefs that are loosely held is really advantageous.<\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Lesson:\u00a0<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We pivoted by talking to our customers and actually building the thing that THEY wanted, and tried not to overcomplicate things. It\u2019s also a case of learning to think from first principles. I think that was part of the problem, we didn\u2019t break down the problem and think of it from first principles and say: \u2018What is the thing we actually need in order to solve this or make things better.\u2019 Instead, we jumped straight to an idea rather than going through the process of bottom-up thinking.<\/p>\n<p>But being wrong feels pretty terrible, mentally. I think that with anything that you pour your blood, sweat, and tears into that doesn\u2019t end up working quite in the way you think, it\u2019s going to be disappointing. But, equally, you iterate and you move on and you keep going.<\/p>\n<p>As people building companies, we get to do the best job in the world. And that is to go through this process of invention and solving problems, and building stuff. The truth is, you\u2019re not going to get it right 100% of the time. It sucks. But get over it and keep going.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;#4: Customers backing out&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]Our biggest customer \u2013 who, looking back, we weren\u2019t set up to handle \u2013 canceled their contract and we went from having some business footing to losing 95% of our revenue in 24 hours. At the time, this was quite categorically terrible.\u00a0 And I did not enjoy that 24 hour period. But on hour 25, you go: \u2018Okay, we have a problem. We had 100% of revenue, and now we\u2019ve got 5% of it, so we need to go and get more.\u2019<\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Lesson:\u00a0<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So you go out, you evaluate the things that are working and you do more of those things. We tried to learn from the fact we weren\u2019t set up for these customers and we weren\u2019t ready. And tried to go and fix that so we\u2019d be ready for them next time. We took a measured approach to iterating our way towards a solution and kept going.<\/p>\n<p>And there are probably two lessons in that. The first is that the best way to deal with a situation like this is to avoid it in the first place.\u00a0Take a measured approach to how you acquire customers and go through an approach of actually validating and building a relationship with them. Make sure the way you are going about building a business is one that can be sustained.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;Key takeaway: learn through the pain&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]But, secondly, if you do find yourself in this situation, go and get another customer. Learn from what happened, improve the product, improve what you\u2019re selling, and improve how you\u2019re selling it. Improve whatever experience it was that led to them not wanting to use your product anymore. You just have to learn from all these experiences, good or bad, and adapt.<\/p>\n<p>So many of the earlier experiences in our business \u2013 whether it was getting laughed out of a VC meeting, or getting sued, or having the wrong idea, or losing our biggest customer \u2013 involved learning from it.\u00a0 Having 20 minutes where you go: \u2018That was awful\u2019 and then iterating and sticking with it.<\/p>\n<p>So much of what business is about is staying alive long enough to be successful. Every idea could probably be successful if you stayed alive long enough. That was probably our approach, even if we didn\u2019t know it at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, we met people who believed in us, refined our idea, and gained our first \u00a3500,000 in funding. And when you go into a room with the mindset that you\u2019re the least qualified person in there (because, as teenagers, we really were) that\u2019s an important lesson in learning how to listen to others.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][split_line_heading animation_type=&#8221;line-reveal-by-space&#8221; font_style=&#8221;h2&#8243; line_reveal_by_space_text_effect=&#8221;default&#8221; content_alignment=&#8221;left&#8221; mobile_content_alignment=&#8221;inherit&#8221; link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; text_content=&#8221;What follows the initial hurdles?&#8221; font_line_height=&#8221;1&#8243;][\/split_line_heading][vc_column_text]<i>After these setbacks, Christian and Harrison adopted an iterative, measured approach to growth for Paddle \u2013 learning how the nuances of each customer differ from the previous one.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Using this principle, the company has experienced great success.

We struggled to find and retain people.<\/p>\n<p>And when I think about the things I\u2019ve got most right, as opposed to the things I\u2019ve got most wrong, they always revolve around hiring people.\u00a0 Someone who is a culturally bad fit can detract from everyone around them, and make everyone less productive. Hiring people in alignment with your values reduces your chance of churn significantly and supports your future hiring efforts.<\/p>\n<p><i>Hire staff that genuinely want to be there and solve problems together. Good traits include being open and transparent.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Paddle\u2019s fundamental competitive difference is that, rather than handing businesses the tools to solve a problem themselves, we just solve the problems for them. We don\u2019t charge any setup costs \u2013 we only win when they win.<\/p>\n<p>This mindset is baked into our business, but it only works if people genuinely care about others\u2019 successes. If someone is constantly kingdom-building for themselves, it causes problems. Having a team that is not siloed, or bureaucratic \u2013 together with a genuine desire to understand how things work \u2013 has been so important for us.<\/p>\n<p><i>Hire constant learners, who don\u2019t think they know it all\u2026and plan hiring in line with growth.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>If you hire for traits like willingness to learn, you end up with people who are adaptable and aren\u2019t precious about things.

They find themselves delegating more responsibility to managers (the middle phase of growth).<\/p>\n<p><i>To shrink this distance between CEO and employees, hold check-ins to maintain strong colleague relationships.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>I used to sit in a room for three days, a couple of times a year, and spend 10 minutes one-on-one with everyone. Sadly, this became impractical, so now, once a week, I meet a different group of 15 people. There\u2019s no planned topic. I just talk and the conversation goes from there.
